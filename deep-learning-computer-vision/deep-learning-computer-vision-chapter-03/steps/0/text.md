Deep learning neural networks are very easy to create and evaluate in Python with Keras, but
you must follow a strict model life-cycle. In this chapter you will discover the step-by-step
life-cycle for creating, training and evaluating deep learning neural networks in Keras and how
to make predictions with a trained model. You will also discover how to use the functional API
that provides more flexibility when designing models. After reading this chapter you will know:

- How to define, compile, fit and evaluate a deep learning neural network in Keras.
- How to select standard defaults for regression and classification predictive modeling
problems.
- How to use the functional API to develop standard Multilayer Perceptron, convolutional
and recurrent neural networks.

Letâ€™s get started.
