Image data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of
a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. Training deep
learning neural network models on more data can result in more skillful models, and the
augmentation techniques can create variations of the images that can improve the ability of
the fit models to generalize what they have learned to new images. The Keras deep learning
neural network library provides the capability to fit models using image data augmentation
via the ImageDataGenerator class. In this tutorial, you will discover how to use image data
augmentation when training deep learning neural networks.

After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- Image data augmentation is used to expand the training dataset in order to improve the
performance and ability of the model to generalize.
- Image data augmentation is supported in the Keras deep learning library via the
ImageDataGenerator class.
- How to use shift, flip, brightness, and zoom image data augmentation.
Letâ€™s get started.
