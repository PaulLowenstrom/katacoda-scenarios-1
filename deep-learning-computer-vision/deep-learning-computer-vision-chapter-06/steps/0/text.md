The Keras deep learning library provides a sophisticated API for loading, preparing, and
augmenting image data. Also included in the API are some undocumented functions that allow
you to quickly and easily load, convert, and save image files. These functions can be convenient
when getting started on a computer vision deep learning project, allowing you to use the same
Keras API initially to inspect and handle image data and later to model it. In this tutorial, you
will discover how to use the basic image handling functions provided by the Keras API. After
completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to load and display an image using the Keras API.
- How to convert a loaded image to a NumPy array and back to PIL format using the Keras
API.
- How to convert a loaded image to grayscale and save it to a new file using the Keras API.
Letâ€™s get started.
