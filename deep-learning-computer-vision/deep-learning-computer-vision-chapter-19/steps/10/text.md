We can use our saved model to make a prediction on new images. The model assumes that new
images are grayscale, they have been segmented so that one image contains one centered piece
of clothing on a black background, and that the size of the image is square with the size 28 Ã— 28
pixels. Below is an image extracted from the MNIST test dataset.

We can run the  code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `deep-learning-python/chapter_18/07_predict_final_model.py` to view file.

#### Run Code
Now, run the python code by running: `python 07_predict_final_model.py`{{execute}}
