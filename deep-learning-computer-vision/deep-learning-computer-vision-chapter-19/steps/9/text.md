We can now load the final model and evaluate it on the hold out test dataset. This is something
we might do if we were interested in presenting the performance of the chosen model to project
stakeholders. The model can be loaded via the load model() function. The complete example
of loading the saved model and evaluating it on the test dataset is listed below

We can run the code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `deep-learning-python/chapter_18/06_evaluate_final_model.py` to view file.


#### Run Code
**Note:** It will take some time to complete.

Now, run the python code by running: `python 06_evaluate_final_model.py`{{execute}}
