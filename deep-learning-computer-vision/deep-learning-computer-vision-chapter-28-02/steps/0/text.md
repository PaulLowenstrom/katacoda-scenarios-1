Face detection is a computer vision problem that involves finding faces in photos. It is a trivial
problem for humans to solve and has been solved reasonably well by classical feature-based
techniques, such as the cascade classifier. More recently deep learning methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark face detection datasets. One example is the
Multi-task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network, or MTCNN for short. In this tutorial, you
will discover how to perform face detection in Python using classical and deep learning models.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- Face detection is a non-trivial computer vision problem for identifying and localizing faces
in images.
- Face detection can be performed using the classical feature-based cascade classifier using
the OpenCV library.
- State-of-the-art face detection can be achieved using a Multi-task Cascade CNN via the
MTCNN library.

Letâ€™s get started.

This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are:
1. Face Detection
2. Test Photographs
3. Face Detection With OpenCV
