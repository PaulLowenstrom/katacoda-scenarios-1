We can run the code now. Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `deep-learning-python/chapter_30/06_face_classification.py` to view file.


#### Run Code
Now, run the python code by running: `python 06_face_classification.py`{{execute}}


Running the example first confirms that the number of samples in the train and test datasets
is as we expect Next, the model is evaluated on the train and test dataset, showing perfect
classification accuracy. This is not surprising given the size of the dataset and the power of the
face detection and face recognition models used.

```

Dataset: train=93, test=25
Accuracy: train=100.000, test=100.000
```
