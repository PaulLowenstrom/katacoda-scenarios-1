Tutorial Overview
This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are:
1. Face Recognition
2. FaceNet Model
3. How to Load a FaceNet Model in Keras
4. How to Detect Faces for Face Recognition
5. How to Develop a Face Classification System

#### Face Recognition
Face recognition is the general task of identifying and verifying people from photographs of
their face (introduced in Chapter 27). The 2011 book on face recognition titled Handbook of
Face Recognition describes two main modes for face recognition, as:
- **Face Verification:** A one-to-one mapping of a given face against a known identity (e.g.
is this the person?).
- **Face Identification:** A one-to-many mapping for a given face against a database of
known faces (e.g. who is this person?)
