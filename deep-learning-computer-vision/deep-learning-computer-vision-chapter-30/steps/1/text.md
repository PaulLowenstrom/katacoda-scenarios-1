Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a
photograph of their face. FaceNet is a face recognition system developed in 2015 by researchers
at Google that achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of face recognition benchmark
datasets. The FaceNet system can be used broadly thanks to multiple third-party open source
implementations of the model and the availability of pre-trained models.
The FaceNet system can be used to extract high-quality features from faces, called face
embeddings, that can then be used to train a face identification system. In this tutorial, you
will discover how to develop a face detection system using FaceNet and an SVM classifier to
identify people from photographs. 

After completing this tutorial, you will know:

-  About the FaceNet face recognition system developed by Google and open source implementations and pre-trained models.
-  How to prepare a face detection dataset including first extracting faces via a face detection
system and then extracting face features via face embeddings.
-  How to fit, evaluate, and demonstrate an SVM model to predict identities from faces
embeddings.

Letâ€™s get started.
