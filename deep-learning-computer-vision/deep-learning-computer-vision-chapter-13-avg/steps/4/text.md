The first max pooling operation is applied as follows:

Given the stride of two, the operation is moved along two columns to the left and the max
is calculated:

Again, the operation is moved along two columns to the left and the max is calculated:

Thatâ€™s it for the first line of pooling operations. The result is the first line of the max pooling
operation:
```
[0.0, 3.0, 0.0]
```
