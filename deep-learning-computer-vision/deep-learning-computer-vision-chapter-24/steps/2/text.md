This tutorial is divided into three parts; they are:
1. YOLO for Object Detection
2. Experiencor YOLO3 Project
3. Object Detection With YOLOv3



### YOLO for Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves both localizing one or more objects
within an image and classifying each object in the image. It is a challenging computer vision
task that requires both successful object localization in order to locate and draw a bounding
box around each object in an image, and object classification to predict the correct class of
object that was localized. The You Only Look Once, or YOLO, family of models are a series
of end-to-end deep learning models designed for fast object detection, developed by Joseph
Redmon


#### Experiencor YOLO3 for Keras Project
Source code for each version of YOLO is available, as well as pre-trained models. The official
DarkNet GitHub repository contains the source code for the YOLO versions mentioned in the
papers, written in C. The repository provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the code for
object detection. It is a challenging model to implement from scratch, especially for beginners as
it requires the development of many customized model elements for training and for prediction.
For example, even using a pre-trained model directly requires sophisticated code to distill and
interpret the predicted bounding boxes output by the model
