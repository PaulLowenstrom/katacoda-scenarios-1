Before you can develop predictive models for image data, you must learn how to load and
manipulate images and photographs. The most popular and de facto standard library in Python
for loading and working with image data is Pillow. Pillow is an updated version of the Python
Image Library, or PIL, and supports a range of simple and sophisticated image manipulation
functionality. It is also the basis for simple image support in other Python libraries such as
SciPy and Matplotlib. In this tutorial, you will discover how to load and manipulate image data
using the Pillow Python library. After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to install the Pillow library and confirm it is working correctly.
- How to load images from file, convert loaded images to NumPy arrays, and save images in
new formats.
- How to perform basic transforms to image data such as resize, flips, rotations, and cropping.
