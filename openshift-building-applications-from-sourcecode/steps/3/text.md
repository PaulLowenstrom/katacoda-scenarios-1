The build process takes some time. During the first phase, you can see a container with -build in its name. This container is deployed from the PHP builder image and is responsible for build operations:
`oc get pod`{{execute}}


After some time, the application will be available. That means that the application's pod should be in a Running state:
`oc get pod`{{execute}}


```
NAME              READY  STATUS     RESTARTS  AGE
phpinfo-1-build   0/1    Completed  0         39s
phpinfo-1-h9xt5   1/1    Running    0         4s
```

OpenShift built and deployed the phpinfo application, which is now available by using its service IP. Let's try to access our application using the curl command:
`oc get svc`{{execute}}

```
NAME    CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S)            AGE
phpinfo **172.30.54.195** <none>      8080/TCP,8443/TCP  1h
```

`curl -s http://<svc-ip>:8080 | head -n 10`{{copy}}


Note
The phpinfo() function displays the PHP configuration as an HTML table.

A summary of the build process can be displayed by running the oc status or oc status -v commands:


`oc status -v`{{execute}}

View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list everything with 'oc get all'.
The preceding command shows that deployment #1 has been rolled out. It can also contain some useful information for troubleshooting the build, in case something goes wrong.

There is another way to display build logs with low-level detailsâ€”using the oc logs command. We need to show the log for the buildconfig (or just bc) entity, which can be displayed, as follows, by using the oc logs bc/phpinfo command:
`oc logs bc/phpinfo`{{execute}}

```

The preceding output gives us some insight into how builds work.
