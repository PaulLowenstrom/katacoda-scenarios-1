In addition to support for multiple chaincode languages, you can also issue a flag that will bring up a five node Raft ordering service or a Kafka ordering service instead of the one node Solo orderer. For more information about the currently supported ordering service implementations, check out The Ordering Service.

To bring up the network with a Raft ordering service, issue:
`./byfn.sh up -o etcdraft`

To bring up the network with a Kafka ordering service, issue:
`./byfn.sh up -o kafka`
