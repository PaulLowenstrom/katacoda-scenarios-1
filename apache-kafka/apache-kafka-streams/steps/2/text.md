Kafka Streams is a library and part of Apache Kafka, used to process streams into and from Kafka. In functional programming, there are several operations over collections, such as the following:

- filter
- map
- flatMap
- groupBy
- join
 
The success of streaming platforms such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Storm, and Akka Streams is to incorporate these stateless functions to process data streams. Kafka Streams provides a DSL to incorporate these functions to manipulate data streams.
