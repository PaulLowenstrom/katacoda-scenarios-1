To build the project, run this command from the kioto directory:
`gradle build`{{execute}} 

If everything is correct, the output is something like the following:

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
6 actionable task: 6 up-to-date
```


The first step is to run a console consumer in **terminal 1** for the uptimes topic, shown as follows:
`~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic uptimes --property print.key=true`{{execute T1}} 


**Note:** 
- Following two commands will run in **terminal 2 & 3** respectively (It will open automatically on executing command). 
- Interface will keep switching back to terminal 1 because consumer is running there after executing above command, you can manually switch by clicking `terminal 2` or `terminal 3`.

#### Run CustomStreamsProcessor
Run the main method of the `CustomStreamsProcessor` in **terminal 2** by running following command.
`cd ~/kafka/Chapter06/kioto && java -cp ./build/libs/kioto-0.1.0.jar kioto.custom.CustomStreamsProcessor`{{execute T2}} 

#### Run CustomProducer
Run the main method of the `CustomProducer` in **terminal 3** by running following command.
`cd ~/kafka/Chapter06/kioto && java -cp ./build/libs/kioto-0.1.0.jar kioto.custom.CustomProducer`{{execute T3}} 

**Important:** Press `Ctrl` + `C` in terminal 1, 2 & 3 to stop everything before proceeding to next step.

The output on the console consumer for the uptimes topic should be similar to the following:

```
      EW05-HV36 33
      BO58-SB28 20
      DV03-ZT93 46
      ...
```
