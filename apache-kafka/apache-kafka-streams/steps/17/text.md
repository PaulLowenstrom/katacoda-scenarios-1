To run the EventProducer, we follow these steps:

Create the events topic, as shown in the following block:
`~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic events --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4`{{execute T1}} 


Run a console consumer in **terminal 1** for the events topic using the following command:
`~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic events`{{execute T1}} 


#### Run EventProducer
Run the main method of the `EventProducer` in **terminal 2** by running following command.
`cd ~/kafka/Chapter06/kioto && java -cp ./build/libs/kioto-0.1.0.jar kioto.events.EventProducer`{{execute T2}} 

The output on the console consumer for the events topic should be similar to the following:

Note that each event window changes every 10 seconds. Also, note how the 54th event is not sent between the 53rd and 55th events. The 54th event, belonging to a previous window, arrives in the next minute between the sixth and seventh seconds
