Welcome to your Libra Lab Exercise!

In this Lab we will get introduced to Libra Blockchain and Move.

Libra is built on a secure, scalable, and reliable blockchain. It is backed by a reserve of assets designed to give it intrinsic value and is governed by the independent Libra Association tasked with evolving the ecosystem.
