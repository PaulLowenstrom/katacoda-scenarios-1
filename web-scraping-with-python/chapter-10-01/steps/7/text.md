ML is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the study of mathematical and statistical algorithms to process and develop an automated system that can learn from data with minimal human involvement. ML predictions and decision-making models are dependent on data. Web scraping is one of the resources that makes data available to ML models.

#### ML and AI
AI is a broad spectrum that covers a wide range of topics, such as neural networks, expert systems, robotics, fuzzy logic, and more. ML is a subset of AI. It explores the idea of building a machine that learns on its own, thus surpassing the need for constant speculation. Therefore, ML has led to a major breakthrough for achieving AI.

ML incorporates the use of several algorithms, thus allowing software to provide accurate results. Making a useful prediction from a set of parsed data is what the concept of ML aims to do. The foremost benefit of ML is that it can tirelessly learn and predict without the need for a hardcoded software regime. Training includes feeding huge datasets as input. This allows an algorithm to learn, process, and make predictions, which are provided as output.


All in all, there are no best metrics. It is common for two people to choose different metrics to reach their goal.
