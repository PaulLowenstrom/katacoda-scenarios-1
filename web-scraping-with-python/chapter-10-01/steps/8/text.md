A Dutch programmer (Guido Van Rossum) launched Python as his side project but did not realize that it would accelerate his height of success. Python is widely adapted among developers when it comes to speedy prototyping. It is gaining popularity among all the ML tools that are available for its readability, versatility, and easiness.

As ML engineers, computer vision engineers, data scientists, or data engineers, we have to juggle with the ideas of linear algebra and calculus, which often get complex once we dive deeper. However, Python comes to the rescue with its quick implementation, thus bypassing the hurdle of the maximum effort. Quick validation of this idea makes the Python programming language more desirable.

Data is everything for ML. Raw data is unstructured, large, incomplete, and has missing values. Data cleaning is one of the most crucial steps of ML so that we can move on with our data. There are many essential libraries available in Python that make the implementation of ML simpler. Various open source repositories in Python help bring changes to the existing method. Web scraping is one of these methods that deals with data that exists on the web, which it then processes further as input to ML models.

The following are some of the most common and widely used libraries that are worth looking at if we decide to work with Python and ML:

- **scikit-learn:** Used for working with classical ML algorithms
- **NumPy (numerical Python):** Designed to work for scientific computing
- **SciPy:** Contains modules for linear algebra, optimization, integration, and statistics
- **pandas:** Used for data aggregation, manipulation, and visualization
- **matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization
- **Bokeh and Plotly:** For interactive visualization
- **TensorFlow and Theano:** Used for deep learning
- **Beautiful Soup, LXML, PyQuery and Scrapy:** Used to withdraw data from HTML and XML documents

Once we have a basic understanding of Python, these libraries can be imported and implemented. Alternatively, we can also apply these functionalities from scratch, which is what most developers do.
