Regular expressions are used to match patterns found in text or strings. Regex can be used for testing and finding patterns as desired against text or web content. Regex contains various ways to define patterns and special notations, such as escape codes to apply some predefined rules. For more information on Regex, please refer to the Further reading section.

There are various cases where Regex can be quite effective and quick for obtaining the desired results. Regex can be applied to content (text or web sources) alone and can be used to target specific information patterns that aren't easily extractable while using XPath, CSS selectors, BS4, PyQuery, and so on.

Sometimes, cases may arise that will demand Regex and XPath or CSS selectors to be used together in order to obtain the desired output. This output can then be tested using Regex in order to find patterns or to clean and manage data. Code editors, document writers, and readers also provide embedded Regex-based utilities.

Regex can be applied to any text or strings of characters, HTML sources, and so on that contain proper or improper formatting. Regex can be used for various applications, such as the following:

- Content based on a particular pattern
- Page links
- Image titles and links
- Texts inside links
- Matching and validating email addresses
- Matching a postal code or zip code from address strings
- Validating phone numbers, and so on

Using tools such as searching, finding, splitting, substituting, matching, and iterating, are applicable with or without other technology interference.  

In the following sections, we will be using the re Python module and exploring its methods, which we can then apply to Regex.
