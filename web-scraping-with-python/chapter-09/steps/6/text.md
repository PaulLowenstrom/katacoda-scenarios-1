Group matches can be individually explored by using the group() method, as shown in the following code:


`print("Group : ",dateMatches.group())`{{execute}}

`print("Groups : ",dateMatches.groups())`{{execute}}

`print("Group 1 : ",dateMatches.group(1))`{{execute}}

`print("Group 5 : ",dateMatches.group(5))`{{execute}}

As we can see, though the pattern has been searched against multiline timeDate, it results in a single group; an individual group can be returned using the index too. An re-related match object contains the groups() and group() functions; groups(0) results in the same output as groups(). Individual elements in groups() will require an index starting from 1. 

- **re.finditer():** This is used to iterate over resulting matches that are obtained for the pattern or pattern object found in the content that's provided. It returns a match (_sre.SRE_Match) object that's found from re.match()
- **re.match():** returns an object that contains various functions and attributes that are used in code examples. These are as follows:

- **start():** Returns the starting character index that matches the expression
- **end():** Returns the ending character index that matches the expression
- **span():** Returns the starting and ending character indexes of the matching expression
- **lastindex:** Returns the index of the last matched expression
- **groupdict():** Returns the matching group dictionary with a pattern string and matched values
- **groups():** Returns all matching elements
- **group():** Returns an individual group and can be accessed with the group name
- **lastgroup:** Returns the name of the last group

```for match in re.finditer(pattern, timeDate):
        s = match.start()
        e = match.end()
        l = match.lastindex
        g = match.groups()
        print('Found {} at {}:{}, groups{} lastindex:{}'.format(timeDate[s:e], s, e,g,l))```{{execute}}

Patterns can also specify string names for the groups they are in; for example, r'(?P<year>[0-9]{4})' matches the year group. Using group-based patterns in Regex helps us to read the pattern and manage the output more accurately; this means that we don't have to worry about indexing.

Let's consider the patterns pDate (implementing group(), groupdict(), start(), end(), lastgroup, and lastindex) with a group name and code that are exhibiting the outputs for date and time, respectively:


`pDate = r'(?P<year>[0-9]{4})(?P<sep>[-])(?P<month>0[1-9]|1[012])-(?P<day>0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])'`{{execute}}

`recompiled = re.compile(pDate) #compiles the pattern`{{execute}}

**Note:** Please press enter to run multiline code after clicking following:

```for match in re.finditer(recompiled,timeDate): #apply pattern on timeDate
        s = match.start()
        e = match.end()
        l = match.lastindex
        print("Group ALL or 0: ",match.groups(0)) #or match.groups() that is all
        print("Group Year: ",match.group('year')) #return year
        print("Group Month: ",match.group('month')) #return month
        print("Group Day: ",match.group('day')) #return day
        print("Group Delimiter: ",match.group('sep')) #return seperator
        print('Found {} at {}:{}, lastindex: {}'.format(timeDate[s:e], s, e,l))
        print('year :',match.groupdict()['year']) #accessing groupdict()
        print('day :',match.groupdict()['day'])
        print('lastgroup :',match.lastgroup) #lastgroup name```{{execute}}

The preceding code results in the following output:


```
Group ALL or 0: ('2019', '-', '02', '11')
Group Year: 2019
Group Month: 02
Group Day: 11
Group Delimiter: -
Found 2019-02-11 at 16:26, lastindex: 4
year : 2019
day : 11
lastgroup : day
```

The following code shows the use of pTime (implementing span()):


`pTime = r'(?P<hour>[0-9]{2})(?P<sep>[:])(?P<min>[0-9]{2}):(?P<sec_mil>[0-9.:+]+)'`{{execute}}

`recompiled = re.compile(pTime)`{{execute}}

```for match in re.finditer(recompiled,timeDate):
        print("Group String: ",match.group()) #groups
        print("Group ALL or 0: ",match.groups())
        print("Group Span: ",match.span()) #using span()
        print("Group Span 1: ",match.span(1))
        print("Group Span 4: ",match.span(4))
        print('hour :',match.groupdict()['hour']) #accessing groupdict()
        print('minute :',match.groupdict()['min'])
        print('second :',match.groupdict()['sec_mil'])
        print('lastgroup :',match.lastgroup) #lastgroup name```{{execute}}

The preceding code will result in the following output:

```
Group String: 12:53:00+00:00
Group ALL or 0: ('12', ':', '53', '00+00:00')
Group Span: (245, 259)
Group Span 1: (245, 247)
Group Span 4: (251, 259)
hour : 12
minute : 53
second : 00+00:00
lastgroup : sec_mil
```

**Important:** Type `quit()`{{execute}} to exit python shell.
