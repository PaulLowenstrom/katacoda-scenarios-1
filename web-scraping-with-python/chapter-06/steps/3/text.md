The implementation of web-based security features (or features that are used to maintain a secure state of access) to access information is rapidly growing, day by day. With ever-growing web-based technologies, websites and web applications deploy secure mechanisms that are basic or highly sophisticated. 

Secure web-enabled content is often challenging from a crawling and scraping perspective. In this section, you will be introduced to a few basic security-based concepts. We will explore these concepts, along with their implementation, in the upcoming sections.

The following sections will talk about a few security-enabled concepts or concepts that are vulnerable to security. These concepts can be implemented independently and collaboratively in websites using a number of underlying tools or measures.

#### Form processing
This is also known as HTML `<form>` processing, form handling, or form submission. This method processes and handles data inside an HTML `<form>`.

HTML `<form>` or elements inside a `<form>` tag with certain specific attributes, are normally used to collect and submit data. Please visit the W3School HTML form (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) for practical examples and detailed information on HTML form.

HTTP methods or request methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and so on, are used to access or submit data across web pages. For more information on HTTP, please visit https://www.w3.org/Protocols/. 

From a security point of view, HTML `<form>` can contain dynamic and hidden or system-generated values that manage validation, provide value to fields, or perform security-based implementation during form submission. Forms with fields such as `<input type="hidden"...>` might not be visible to users in pages. The user must get help from the page source or browser-based developer tools in such cases.

A web page with a form might be displaying in certain fields and asking for input, and can contain a few more fields on the backend or in the source, which can contain user-or system-based information. Such information is collected and processed behind the scenes for web-based analysis, marketing, user and system identification, managing security, and more.
