Now, let's begin by loading mainUrl and loginUrl, respectively:

```
requests.get(mainUrl)
response = requests.get(loginUrl)
```

The following screenshot shows what a login page looks like when using `loginUrl`:

The following code accepts cookies from response and is used in headers:

```
setCookie = responseCookies(response)
print("Set-Cookie: ",setCookie)
```

As we can see from the preceding screenshot, Request Headers contains key=Cookie with a value beginning with sessio=...., also known as the session ID. This information is found in both response.headers and response.cookies, and the responseCookies() function returns the cookie value from response.headers before printing the details:

```
Headers: {'Set-Cookie': session=eyJjc3JmX3Rva2VuIjoicUlPVGNnQ2FKZmJaS3NOdmlIREFWbVdvWGtMakJkVXl1U3BScmVZTWhRd0d6dEZueFBsRSJ9.D68Log.3ANox76h0whpTRjkqNo7JRgCtWI; HttpOnly; Path=/',...,'Content-Encoding':'gzip','Content-Type':'text/html; charset=utf-8',......}

Set-Cookie: session=eyJjc3JmX3Rva2VuIjoicUlPVGNnQ2FKZmJaS3NOdmlIREFWbVdvWGtMakJkVXl1U3BScmVZTWhRd0d6dEZueFBsRSJ9.D68Log.3ANox76h0whpTRjkqNo7JRgCtWI; HttpOnly; Path=/
```


A session ID is a unique number that a website's server assigns to a specific user for a certain duration or for a session. This ID can be stored in certain <form> fields or cookies, or even appended to a URL query string. 
Now that we've received the cookie-based session value, we need to maintain this value so that we have a successful login procedure.

Let's collect the <form>-based fields and more information on form submission:

![](https://github.com/fenago/katacoda-scenarios/raw/master/web-scraping-with-python/chapter-06/steps/10/2.png)

As we can see from the preceding screenshot, <form> is using HTTP POST to submit form fields to loginUrl, and there's also a hidden <input> field with csrf_token, along with the fields accepting the login credentials. 

**Note:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or session riding is a security measure that is used to identify each individual request between a user and a website. Generally, CSRF_TOKEN or a token is used to manage such a mechanism. A token is a random string generated by websites when a request to the page is made by a user. A token value is required to process any form of HTTP request to the website. The token value keeps changing for each successful request. An HTML <form> containing a token value can be processed with either an updated or deleted token, which are not accepted by websites.
