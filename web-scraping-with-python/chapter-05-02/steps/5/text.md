We will be creating a Quotes project to obtain author quotes related to web scraping from http://toscrape.com/, accessing information from the first five pages or less which exists using the URL http://quotes.toscrape.com/.

We are now going to start the Quotes project. From the Command Prompt, run or execute the scrapy startproject Quotes command as seen in the following screenshot:

 `scrapy startproject Quotes`{{execute}}

If successful, the preceding command will be the creation of a new folder named Quotes (that is, the project root directory) with additional files and subfolders.

Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `Quotes` folder to view scrapy project files.
