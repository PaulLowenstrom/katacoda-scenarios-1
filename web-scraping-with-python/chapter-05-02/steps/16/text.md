Deploying a web crawler online or on a live server will certainly improve the effectiveness of the crawling activity, with its speed, updated technology, web spaces, anytime usage, and so on. Local tests and confirmation are required before deploying online. We need to own or buy web spaces with web-hosting companies or the cloud server.
