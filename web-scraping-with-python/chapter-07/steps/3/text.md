A web-based application programming information, or web-based API, is an interface provided by a website to return information for the request that's received. A web API (or API) is actually a web service that's provided by websites to users or third-party web applications or automated scripts in order to share and exchange information.

Generally, this is a user interface (UI) that's processed via a web browser for retrieving certain information from requests that have been made to a website or web server. Websites with large amount of information of any type can provide a web API to their user, which facilitates information sharing.

API in the field of software applications is known for its set of facilities, such as methods and libraries, which can be used to further enhance, build, or develop applications. This is also known as a developer API.
Web APIs are not dependent on any programming languages. They enable easy access to web-based information in a raw format, and usually return a structured response in JSON, XML, or CSV format. 

They work on the HTTP principle (request and response cycle), but accept only sets of a predefined format of requests and parameters to generate a response. In terms of security concerns, many APIs also provide authentication tools, such as an API key, which is required to make a request to a website.
