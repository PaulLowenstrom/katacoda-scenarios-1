Day by day, information requirements are growing, along with their availability across the web. Information sources, their availability, facilities, and technologies to share and exchange have become a global demand. The API is one of the preferred data sources and can be used to retrieve data. 

API is not only a way of communicating with a user via a web browser â€“ you can also use systems. APIs allow communication between systems and devices, such as mobiles, despite their underlying system or programming languages. Many mobile apps generate requests to certain APIs and display related information that has been retrieved from responses. APIs are not just a simple service for retrieving data; they are used to exchange and process information and even communicate between systems across different platforms and services.

From a web scraping perspective, responses or data that's available through APIs are preferred over data that's retrieved using scraping scripts. This is due to the following reasons:

An API's returned data is completely specific to the requests being performed, along with the filters or parameters that have been applied to it.
Tasks such as parsing HTML or XML using Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup, pyquery, and lxml, isn't always required.
The format of the data is structured and easy to handle.
Data cleaning and processing for final listings will be more easy or might not be required.
There will be significant reductions in processing time (compared to coding, analyzing the web, and applying XPath and CSS selectors to retrieve data).
They are easy to process.
There are also certain factors to be considered before adapting completely to the web API from a scraping point of view, including the following:

Not all websites provide users with access to web APIs.
Responses from APIs are specific to the set of predefined parameters. This might restrict the exact requests based on requirements that can be made, and restrict the availability of data to be obtained immediately.

Responses that are returned are limited to a certain volume, such as the number of records returned per request and the maximum number of requests allowed.
Although data will be available in a structured format, it can be distributed across key-value pairs, which might require some additional merging tasks.
Given these points, we can see that the web API is the preferred choice for obtaining information from websites.
