We now have an idea about what web scraping is, what the core development technologies that exist are, and where or how we can plan to find the information we are looking for.

Web scraping requires tools and techniques to be implemented and deployed using scripts or programs. The Python programming language consists of a huge set of libraries that are fit for interacting with the web and for scraping purposes. In this scenario, we will communicate with web resources using Python; we'll also explore and search for the contents to be extracted from the web. 

This chapter will also provide a detailed overview of using Python libraries such as requests and urllib.

In particular, we will learn about the following topic(s):

- Setting Python and its required libraries, requests and urllib, to load URLs

The Python libraries that are required for this chapter are as follows:
