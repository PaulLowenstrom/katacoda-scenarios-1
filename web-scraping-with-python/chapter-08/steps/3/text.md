As I mentioned, Selenium is a web application framework that can be used for web scraping activities. It can also be used as a browser automation tool. 

The automation of tasks or activities related to web applications, such as those in the following list, involves those tasks being performed without the direct involvement of human beings:

- Browsing
- Clicking links
- Saving screenshots
- Downloading images
- Filling out HTML `<form>` templates and many more activities

Selenium provides a web browser as an interface or automated tool. With the automation of the browsing action, Selenium can also be used in web scraping. Dynamic or secure web services that use JavaScript, cookies, scripts, and so on are loaded, tested, and even crawled and scraped with the help of Selenium.
