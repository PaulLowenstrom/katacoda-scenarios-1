Selenium is open source and can be accessed across multiple platforms. Various web browsers can be used for testing using libraries that are available for programming languages such as Java, and Python. Libraries are used to create scripts that interact with Selenium to perform browser-based automation.

Although using Selenium in application testing has many advantages when it comes to actions such as crawling and scraping, it also has its disadvantages, such as time and memory consumption. Selenium is extendable and effective, but is slow in performing its actions, and consumes large amounts of memory space.

#### Setup
In the following section, we will set up Selenium WebDriver and test the setup with a Python library, which can be found at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/. 

Selenium is a web testing framework, whereas Selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) is a Python library that binds Selenium WebDriver or is used to create scripts to interact with Selenium.

Application testing is performed to ensure that the requirements are met by the application and that bugs and errors are detected to ensure a quality product. It can be conducted either manually (with the help of users) or by using automated tools (such as Selenium). Testing web-based applications is done prior to the launch of the application over the internet.
