pyquery is a jQuery-like library for Python that uses the lxml library. This provides an easy and interactive environment for dealing with markup elements in terms of manipulation and traversal purposes.

pyquery expressions are also similar to jquery, and users with jquery knowledge will find it more convenient to use in Python.
The pyquery Python library, as its name suggests, enhances query writing procedures related to elements found in XML and HTML. pyquery shortens element processing and provides a more insightful scripting approach that is fit for scraping and DOM-based traversal and manipulation tasks.

pyquery expressions use CSS selectors to perform queries, alongside additional features that it implements. For example, the following expression is used by pyquery:

```
page.find('a').attr('href')    -- (pyquery expression) 
```

The following expression is used by cssselect:

```
cssselect('a').get('href')      -- (cssselect expression)
```

jQuery (write less, do more) is one of the most admired JavaScript libraries and is small, quick, and has lots of features that support DOM/HTML/CSS, and more. Web document-based traversing, manipulation, event handling, animation, AJAX, and more are some of its main features. Please visit https://jquery.com/ for more information.
