Now we will explore certain features from pyquery that are relevant to scraping concepts. For this purpose, we will be using a page source available from https://www.python.org that has been saved locally as test.html to provide real-world usability:

In Google Chrome, you can right-click on the web page and choose the View page source menu option or press Ctrl + U to obtain the page source.
Obtaining the page source or HTML code only is not enough, though, as we need to load this content into the library to gain more tools to explore with. We'll be doing this in the upcoming section.

While testing or following the code, you might find or require changes to be done on the pyquery code expressions in order to obtain the real output. Page sources that are obtained now might be updated or changed. You are suggested to obtain the latest page source from the source URL (https://www.python.org).
