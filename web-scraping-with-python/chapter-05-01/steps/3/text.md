Web scraping is a procedure for extracting data from web documents. For data collection or extracting data from web documents, identifying and traversing through elements (of HTML, XML) is the basic requirement. Web documents are built with various types of elements that can exist either individually or nested together.

Parsing is an activity of breaking down, exposing, or identifying the components with contents from any given web content. Such activity enhances features such as searching and collecting content from the desired element or elements. Web documents obtained, parsed, and traversed through looking for required data or content is the basic scraping task. 

In the next subsection, we will learn and explore features of the Python bs4 library (for Beautiful Soup). 

#### Introduction to Beautiful Soup
Beautiful Soup is generally identified as a parsing library, and is also known as an HTML parser that is used to parse web documents either in HTML or XML. It generates a parsed tree similar to lxml (ElementTree), which is used to identify and traverse through elements to extract data and perform web scraping.

Beautiful Soup provides complete parsing-related features that are available using lxml and htmllib. Collections of simple and easy-to-use methods, plus properties to deal with navigation, searching, and parsing-related activity, make Beautiful Soup a favorite among other Python libraries.

Document encoding can be handled manually using the Beautiful Soup constructor, but Beautiful Soup handles encoding-related tasks automatically unless specified by the constructor.
