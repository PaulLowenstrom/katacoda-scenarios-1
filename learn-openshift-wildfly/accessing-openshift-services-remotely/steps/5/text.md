Great. The shell will hang on. Now let's try to connect from the host to the remote database, passing as argument the `user` and `password` generated by the template:

`yum install mysql -y`{{execute}}

`mysql -u<username> -p<password> --protocol tcp -h localhost`{{copy}} 

As you can see we managed to connect to the remote database.

`use sampledb;`{{execute}}

`show databases;`{{execute}}

`quit`{{execute}}
