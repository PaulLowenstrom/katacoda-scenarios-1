In this article we will learn how to connect to services running in Openshift Paas from external clients

Out of the box Openshift uses the router component to let external clients access the services running in the Paas. The router is however limited to HTTP/HTTPS(SNI)/TLS(SNI), which covers web applications. In this article we will see how to access some services from remote clients using the simple mechanism provided by the oc port-forward command.


#### Openshift Templates

Now we will add an application out of the available templates:
Once ready, open a terminal and at the command prompt, enter the following command to create a Java web application.

`oc get templates -n openshift`{{execute}}

For our example, we will create a mysql database, and let the template assign some defaults:
`oc new-app mysql-ephemeral --name=mysqldemo`{{execute}}


#### Output
And the output should look something like this:

```
