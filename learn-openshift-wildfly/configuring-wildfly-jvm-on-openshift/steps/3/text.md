The build process takes some time. During the first phase, you can see a container with -build in its name. This container is deployed from the WildFly builder image and is responsible for build operations:
`oc get pod`{{execute}}


**Note:** Please wait for the deployment to complete and all the pods to be running, It will take around **2 minutes** to complete.


After some time, the application will be available. That means that the application's pod should be in a Running state:
`oc get pod`{{execute}}

```
