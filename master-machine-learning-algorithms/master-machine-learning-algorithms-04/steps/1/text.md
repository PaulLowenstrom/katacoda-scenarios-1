Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics.
It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). In this
chapter you will discover the logistic regression algorithm for machine learning. After reading
this chapter you will know:
- The many names and terms used when describing logistic regression (like log odds and
logit).
- The representation used for a logistic regression model.
- Techniques used to learn the coefficients of a logistic regression model from data.
- How to actually make predictions using a learned logistic regression model.
Letâ€™s get started.
