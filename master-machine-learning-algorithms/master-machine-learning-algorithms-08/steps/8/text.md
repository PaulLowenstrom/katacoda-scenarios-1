It is easy to visualize these scenarios for one group, but the concepts translate to summing
the proportions across the LEFT and RIGHT groups. You can see when the group has a 50-50
mix in the first row, that Gini is 0.5. This is the worst possible split. You can also see a case
where the group only has data instances with class 0 on the last row and a Gini index of 0. This
is an example of a perfect split.

The calculation of the Gini index for a chosen split point involves calculating the Gini index
for each child node and weighting the scores by the number of instances in the parent node, as
follows:

Our goal in selecting a split point is to evaluate the Gini index of all possible split points and
greedily select the split point with the lowest cost. Letâ€™s make this more concrete by calculating
the cost of selecting different data points as our split point.
