In this chapter you discovered exactly how to construct a CART model and use it to make
predictions. You learned how to:
- Calculate the Gini index for a candidate split in a decision tree.
- Evaluate any candidate split points using Gini index.
- How to create a decision tree from scratch to make predictions.
- How to make predictions on new data using a learned decision tree.
You now know how to implement CART from scratch.
