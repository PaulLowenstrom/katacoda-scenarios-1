In this tutorial we will work through a simple binary (two-class) classification problem for
CART. To keep things simple we will work with a two input variables (X1 and X2) and a single
output variable (Y ). This is not a real problem but a contrived problem to demonstrate how
to implement the CART model and make predictions. The example was designed so that the
algorithm will find at least two split points in order to best classify the training dataset. The
raw data for this problem is as follows:

When visualized as a two-dimensional scatter plot the dataset looks as follows:
