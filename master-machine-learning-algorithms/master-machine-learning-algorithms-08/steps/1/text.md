Decision trees are a flexible and very powerful machine learning method for regression and
classification predictive modeling problems. In this chapter you will discover how to implement
the CART machine learning algorithm from scratch step-by-step. After completing this chapter
you will know:
- How to calculate the Gini index for a given split in a decision tree.
- How to evaluate different split points when constructing a decision tree.
- How to make predictions on new data with a learned decision tree.
Letâ€™s get started.
