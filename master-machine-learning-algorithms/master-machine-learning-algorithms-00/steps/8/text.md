You can calculate a Gaussian random number using the NORMINV() function. Remember
that Gaussian refers to distribution that has a bell shape. Many linear machine learning
algorithms assume a Gaussian distribution. For example, the expression =NORMINV(RAND(),
10, 1) will generate Gaussian random numbers with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation
of 1
