You can do basic flow control in your spreadsheet.
- You can conditionally evaluate a cell using the IF() function. It takes three arguments,
the first is the condition to evaluate, the second is the expression to use if the condition
evaluates true, and the final argument is the expression to use if the condition evaluates
false. For example the expression =IF(1>2,"YES","NO") evaluates as NO.
