Let’s try working with the mathematical constant Euler’s number (e).
- We can raise a number to e using the function EXP(). For example the expression =EXP(2)
will evaluate as 7.389056099. This can also be written as e2.
- We can calculate the natural logarithm of a number using the function LN(). Remember
that the natural logarithm is the inverse operation of raising e to a power. For example
the expression =LN(7.389056099) will evaluate as 2.
Some other useful stuff:
- You can calculate the mathematical constant PI using the PI() function. For example,
the expression =PI() evaluates as 3.141592654. PI is usually written as π.
