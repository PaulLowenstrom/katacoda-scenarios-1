Many machine learning algorithms need to use statistical summaries of input data. Let’s take a
look at how we can summarize data.
- You can calculate the mean or average of a list of numbers using the AVERAGE() function.
Remember that the average is the middle or central tendency of a list of numbers. For
example, the expression =AVERAGE(1,2,3) will evaluate as 2. Often the mean is referred
to as µ (mu).
- You can calculate the mode of a list of numbers using the MODE() function. Remember
that the mode of a list of numbers is the most common value in the list. For example the
expression =MODE(2,2,3) will evaluate as 2.
