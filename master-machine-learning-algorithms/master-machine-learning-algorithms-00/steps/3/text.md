Letâ€™s try working with exponents.
- You can raise a number to a power using the ^ operator. For example the expression =2^2
will square the number 2 and evaluate as 4. This is often written as 22.
- You can calculate the logarithm of a number for a base using the LOG() function, defaulting
to base 10. Remember that the log is the inverse operation of raising a number to a power.
For example the expression =LOG(4,2) will calculate the logarithm of 4 using base 2 and
will evaluate as 2.
- You can calculate the square root of a number using the SQRT() function. For example,
the expression =SQRT(4) evaluates as 2. This is often written as p4.
