- You can calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers using the STDEV() function.
Remember that the standard deviation is the average spread of the points from the mean
value. For example the expression =STDEV(1,2,3) evaluates as 1. Often the standard
deviation is referred to as Ïƒ (sigma).8.3. Random Numbers 28
- You can calculate the correlation between two lists of numbers using the PEARSON()
function. Remember that a correlation of 1 and -1 indicate a perfect positive and negative correlation respectively. For example the expression =PEARSON(f2,3,4g,f4,5,6g)
evaluates as 1 (perfectly positively correlated).
All of these examples used in-line lists of numbers but can just as easily use ranges of cells
as inputs.
