Letâ€™s start with some basic spreadsheet navigation and arithmetic.
- A cell can evaluate an expression using the equals (=) and then the expression. For
example the expression =1+1 will evaluate as 2.
- You can add the values from multiple cells using the SUM() function. For example the
expression =SUM(A7:C7) will evaluate the sum or the values in the range from cell A7 to
cell C7. Often summing over a range, say 1 to n using the iterator variable i is written
mathematically as ![](https://github.com/fenago/katacoda-scenarios/raw/master/master-machine-learning-algorithms/master-machine-learning-algorithms-00/01.JPG)

- You can count cells in a range using the COUNT() function. For example the expression
`=COUNT(A7:C7)` will evaluate to 3 because there are 3 cells in the range.
