In this chapter you discovered how to implement the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from
scratch. You learned about:
- The Gaussian Probability Density Function for estimating the probability of any given
real value.
- How to estimate the probabilities required by the Naive Bayes model from a training
dataset.
- How to use the learned Naive Bayes model to make predictions.
You now know how to implement Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch for real-valued data.
In the next chapter you will discover the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and
regression.
