Naive Bayes is a simple model that uses probabilities calculated from your training data to
make predictions on new data. The basic Naive Bayes algorithm assumes categorical data. A
simple extension for real-valued data is called Gaussian Naive Bayes. In this chapter you will
discover how to implement Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch. After reading this chapter you
will know:
- The Gaussian Probability Density Function and how to calculate the probability of real
values.
- How to learn the properties for a Gaussian Naive Bayes model from your training data.
- How to use a learned Gaussian Naive Bayes model to make predictions on new data.
Letâ€™s get started.
