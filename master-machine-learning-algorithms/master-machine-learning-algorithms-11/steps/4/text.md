The Gaussian Probability Density Function (PDF) will calculate the probability of a value given
the mean and standard deviation of the distribution from which it came. The Gaussian PDF is
calculated as follows:

Where pdf(x) is the Gaussian PDF, mean and sd are the mean and standard deviation
calculated above, π is the numerical constant PI, e is Euler’s number raised to a power and x
is the input value for the input variable. Let’s look at an example. Let’s assume we have real
values drawn from a population that has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
