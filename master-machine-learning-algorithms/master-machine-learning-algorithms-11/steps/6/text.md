There are two types of probabilities that we need to summarize from our training data for the
naive Bayes model:
- Class Probabilities.
- Conditional Probabilities.

#### Class Probabilities
The dataset is a two class problem and we already know the probability of each class because
we contrived the dataset. Nevertheless, we can calculate the class probabilities for classes 0 and21.4. Make Prediction with Gaussian Naive Bayes 97
1 as follows:

This works out to be a probability of 0.5 (50%) for any given data instance belonging to
class 0 or class 1.
