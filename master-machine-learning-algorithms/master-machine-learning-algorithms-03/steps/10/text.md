In this chapter you discovered the simple linear regression model and how to train it using
stochastic gradient descent. You learned:
- How to work through the application of the update rule for gradient descent.
- How to make predictions using a learned linear regression model.
You now know how to implement linear regression using stochastic gradient descent. In the
next chapter you will discover the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification.
