Stochastic Gradient Descent is an important and widely used algorithm in machine learning. In
this chapter you will discover how to use Stochastic Gradient Descent to learn the coefficients
for a simple linear regression model by minimizing the error on a training dataset. After reading
this chapter you will know:
- How stochastic gradient descent can be used to search for the coefficients of a regression
model.
- How repeated iterations of gradient descent can create an accurate regression model.
Letâ€™s get started.
