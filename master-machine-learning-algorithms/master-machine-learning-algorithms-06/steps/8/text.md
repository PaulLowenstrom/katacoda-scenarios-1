Linear Discriminant Analysis is a simple and effective method for classification. Because it is
simple and so well understood, there are many extensions and variations to the method. Some
popular extensions include:
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis: Each class uses its own estimate of variance (or covariance when there are multiple input variables).
- Flexible Discriminant Analysis: Where nonlinear combination of inputs is used such as
splines.
- Regularized Discriminant Analysis: Introduces regularization into the estimate of the
variance (or covariance), moderating the influence of different variables on LDA.
The original development was called the Linear Discriminant or Fisherâ€™s Discriminant
Analysis. The multiclass version was referred to Multiple Discriminant Analysis. These are all
simply referred to as Linear Discriminant Analysis now.
