We are going to step through how to calculate an LDA model for simple dataset with one input
and one output variable. This is the simplest case for LDA. This tutorial will cover:

1. **Dataset:** Introduce the dataset that we are going to model. We will use the same dataset
as the training and the test dataset.
2. **Learning the Model:** How to learn the LDA model from the dataset including all of
the statistics needed to make predictions.
3. **Making Predictions:** How to use the learned model to make predictions for each instance
in the training dataset.
