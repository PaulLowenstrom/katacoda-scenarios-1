Linear Discriminant Analysis is a linear method for classification predictive modeling problems.
In this chapter you will discover how Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) works by implementing
the algorithm step-by-step from scratch for a simple dataset. After reading this chapter you
will know:
- The assumptions made by LDA about your training data.
- How to calculate statistics required by the LDA model from your data.
- How to make predictions using the learned LDA model.

Letâ€™s get started.
