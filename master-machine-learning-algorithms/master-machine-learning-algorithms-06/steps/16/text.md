We can see that the discriminant value for Y = 0 (12.3293558) is larger than the discriminate
value for Y = 1 (-130.3349038), therefore the model predicts Y = 0. Which we know is correct.
You can proceed to calculate the Y values for each instance in the dataset, as follows:

If you compare the predictions to the dataset, you can see that LDA has achieved an accuracy
of 100% (no errors). This is not surprising given that the dataset was contrived so that the
groups for Y = 0 and Y = 1 were clearly separable.
