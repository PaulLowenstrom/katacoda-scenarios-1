Logistic regression is a classification algorithm traditionally limited to only two-class classification
problems. If you have more than two classes then the Linear Discriminant Analysis is the
preferred linear classification technique. In this chapter you will discover the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for classification predictive modeling problems. After reading this
chapter you will know.
- The limitations of logistic regression and the need for linear discriminant analysis.
- The representation of the model that is learned from data and can be saved to file.
- How the model is estimated from your data.
- How to make predictions from a learned LDA model.
- How to prepare your data to get the most from the LDA model.
Letâ€™s get started.
