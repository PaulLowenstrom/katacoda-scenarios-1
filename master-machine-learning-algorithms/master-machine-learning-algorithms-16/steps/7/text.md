In this tutorial we will use a dataset with two input variables (X1 and X2) and one output
variable (Y). The input variables are real-valued random numbers drawn from a Gaussian
distribution. The output variable has two values, making the problem a binary classification
problem. The raw data is listed below.

Plotting the raw data, you can see that the classes are not clearly separated.
