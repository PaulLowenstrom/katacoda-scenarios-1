In this chapter you discovered how to work through implementing an AdaBoost model from
scratch step-by-step. You learned:
- How to create decision stumps from training data using weighted training data.
- How to update the weights in the training data so that more attention is put on difficult
to classify instances.
- How to create a sequence of 3 models one after the other.
- How to use an AdaBoost model with three weak models to make predictions.
You now know how to implement the AdaBoost machine learning algorithm from scratch.
This concludes your introduction to ensemble machine learning algorithms.
