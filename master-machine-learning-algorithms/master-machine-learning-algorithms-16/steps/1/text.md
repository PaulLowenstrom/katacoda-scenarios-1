AdaBoost is one of the first boosting ensemble machine learning algorithms. In this chapter you
will discover how AdaBoost for machine learning works step-by step. After reading this chapter
you will know:
- How to create decision stumps from training data using weighted training data.
- How to update the weights in the training data so that more attention is put on difficult
to classify instances.
- How to create a sequence of 3 models one after the other.
- How to use an AdaBoost model with three weak models to make predictions.
Letâ€™s get started.
