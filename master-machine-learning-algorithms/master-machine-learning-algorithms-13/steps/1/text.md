The Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm is a lot like the k-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm, but it involves learning. In this chapter you will discover how to implement the LVQ
algorithm from scratch. After reading this chapter you will know:
- How to initialize an LVQ model.
- How to Update the Best Matching Unit for a training instance.
- How to update the LVQ model for one and multiple epochs.
- How to use a learned LVQ model to make predictions.
Letâ€™s get started.
