The problem is a binary (two-class) classification problem. The problem was contrived for this
tutorial. The dataset contains two input variables (X1 and X2) and the class output variable
with the values 0 and 1. The dataset contains 10 records, 5 that belong to each class.

You can see that the data for each class is quite separated. This is intentional to make the
problem easy to work with so that we can focus on the learning algorithm.
