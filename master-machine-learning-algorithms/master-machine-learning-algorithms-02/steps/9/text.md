We now have the coefficients for our simple linear regression equation.

```
y = B0 + B1 × x
y = 0.4 + 0.8 × x
```

Let’s try out the model by making predictions for our training data.

x | Predicted Y
--- | ---
1 | 1.2
2 | 2
4 | 3.6
3 | 2.8
5 | 4.4

We can plot these predictions as a line with our data. This gives us a visual idea of how
well the line models our data.
