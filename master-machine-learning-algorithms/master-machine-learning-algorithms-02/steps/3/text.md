The data set we are using is completely made up. Below is the raw data.

x | y
--- | ---
1 | 1
2 | 3
4 | 3
3 | 2
5 | 5

The attribute x is the input variable and y is the output variable that we are trying to
predict. If we got more data, we would only have x values and we would be interested in
predicting y values. Below is a simple scatter plot of x versus y.

We can see the relationship between x and y looks kind-of linear. As in, we could probably
draw a line somewhere diagonally from the bottom left of the plot to the top right to generally
describe the relationship between the data. This is a good indication that using linear regression
might be appropriate for this little dataset.
