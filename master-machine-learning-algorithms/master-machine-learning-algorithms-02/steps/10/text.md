We can calculate an error score for our predictions called the Root Mean Squared Error or `RMSE`.

Where you can use SQRT() function in your spreadsheet to calculate the square root, p is the
predicted value and y is the actual value, i is the index for a specific instance, because we must
calculate the error across all predicted values. First we must calculate the difference between
each model prediction and the actual y values.

We can easily calculate the square of each of these error values (error Ã— error or error2).

The sum of these errors is 2.4 units, dividing by 5 and taking the square root gives us:

```
RMSE = 0.692820323
```

Or, each prediction is on average wrong by about 0.692 units.
