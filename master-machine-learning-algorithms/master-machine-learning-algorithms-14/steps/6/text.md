A test problem was devised so that the classes are linearly separable. This means that a straight
line can be drawn to separate the classes. This is intentional so that we can explore how to
implement an SVM with a linear kernel (straight line). An assumption made by the SVM
algorithm is that first class value is âˆ’1 and the second class value is +1.
