This section lists some suggestions for how to best prepare your training data when learning an
SVM model.
- Numerical Inputs: SVM assumes that your inputs are numeric. If you have categorical
inputs you may need to covert them to binary dummy variables (one variable for each
category).
- Binary Classification: Basic SVM as described in this chapter is intended for binary
(two-class) classification problems. Although, extensions have been developed for regression
and multiclass classification.
