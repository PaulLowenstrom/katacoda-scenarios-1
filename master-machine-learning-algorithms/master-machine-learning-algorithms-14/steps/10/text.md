We now have updated coefficients that we can use on the next iteration of the learning
algorithm with the second instance from the training dataset: Instance: X1 = 3:032830419,
X2 = 3:170770366, Y = −1. Again, we must keep track of the iteration: t = 2. Let’s repeat the
process.

The output value is larger than 1.0, suggesting that this training instance is not a support
vector. We can update the B1 coefficient accordingly:
