Support Vector Machines are a flexible nonparametric machine learning algorithm. In this
chapter you will discover how to implement the Support Vector Machine algorithm step-by-step
using sub-gradient descent. After completing this chapter you will know:
- How to use sub-gradient descent to update the coefficients for an SVM model.
- How to iterate the sub-gradient descent algorithm to learn an SVM model for training
data.
- How to make predictions given a learned SVM model.
Letâ€™s get started.
