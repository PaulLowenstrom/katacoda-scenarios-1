Now that we have coefficients for the line, we can make predictions. In this section we will make
predictions for the training data, but this could just as easily be adapted to make predictions
for new data. Predictions can be made using the following equation:

Using the above coefficients and these prediction rules, we can make a prediction for each
instance in the training dataset:

Comparing the crisp prediction (Crisp) to the expected output column (Y ), we can see that
our model has achieved 100% accuracy.
