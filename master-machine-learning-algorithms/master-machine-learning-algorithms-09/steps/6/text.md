The dataset describes two categorical input variables and a class variable that has two outputs.

We can convert this into numbers. Each input has only two values and the output class
variable has two values. We can convert each variable to binary as follows:
- Weather: sunny = 1, rainy = 0
- Car: working = 1, broken = 0
- Class: go-out = 1, stay-home = 0

Therefore, we can restate the dataset as:

This can make the data easier to work with in a spreadsheet or code if you are following
