There are two types of quantities that need to be calculated from the dataset for the naive
Bayes model:
- Class Probabilities.
- Conditional Probabilities.
Letâ€™s start with the class probabilities.


#### Calculate the Class Probabilities
The dataset is a two class problem and we already know the probability of each class because
we contrived the dataset. Nevertheless, we can calculate the class probabilities for classes 0 and
1 as follows:

This works out to be a probability of 0.5 for any given data instance belonging to class 0 or class 1
