Naive Bayes is a very simple classification algorithm that makes some strong assumptions about
the independence of each input variable. Nevertheless, it has been shown to be effective in a
large number of problem domains. In this chapter you will discover the Naive Bayes algorithm
for categorical data. After reading this chapter you will know.
- How to work with categorical data for Naive Bayes.
- How to prepare the class and conditional probabilities for a Naive Bayes model.
- How to use a learned Naive Bayes model to make predictions.
Letâ€™s get started.
