Random Forest is one of the most popular and most powerful machine learning algorithms. It is
a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging. In this
chapter you will discover the Bagging ensemble algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm for
predictive modeling. 

Bagging is a simple ensemble method that almost always results in a lift in performance over
the baseline models. In this chapter you will discover how to implement bagged decision trees
step-by-step. After reading this chapter you will discover:
- How to create decision trees from bootstrap samples of your training dataset.
- How to aggregate the predictions from multiple bootstrap samples.
- How bagging can create more accurate predictions than individual high-variance models.
Letâ€™s get started.
