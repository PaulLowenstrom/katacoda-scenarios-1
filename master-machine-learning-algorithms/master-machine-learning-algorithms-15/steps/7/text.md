In this tutorial we will use dataset with two input variables (X1 and X2) and one output
variable (Y ). The input variables are real-valued random numbers drawn from a Gaussian
distribution. The output variable has two values, making the problem a binary classification
problem. The raw data is listed below.

Below is a plot of the dataset. You see that we cannot draw a straight line to separate the
classes.
