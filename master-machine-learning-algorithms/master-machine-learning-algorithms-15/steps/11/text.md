The split point used by the third model is X2 â‰¤ 0.925340325. Using this split point, we can
again sort the training dataset into two groups.

In this model the RIGHT group will classify instances as class 0 and the LEFT group as
class 1. Using this simple model, we can again make predictions for each training instance.

This model has slightly worse accuracy of 70%. Importantly it correctly predicts both the
second last instance and the 5th instance, clearing up any ambiguity if the previous two models
were combined.
