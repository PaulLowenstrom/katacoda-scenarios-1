The second model uses the split point X1 â‰¤ 4:090032824. We can separate the training data
into two groups:

As above, the LEFT group will classify instances as class 0 and the RIGHT as class 1. Using
this model, we can make predictions for all instances in the training dataset:

Again, like the first model, we can see the accuracy is 90% with only one instance misclassified.
This time the 5th instance. Combining just these two models results in some ambiguous
predictions where the models conflict in their predictions. Adding a third model will clear things
up.
