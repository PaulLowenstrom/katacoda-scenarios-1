Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in
statistics and machine learning. In this chapter you will discover the linear regression algorithm,
how it works and how you can best use it in on your machine learning projects. In this chapter
you will learn:
- Why linear regression belongs to both statistics and machine learning.
- The many names by which linear regression is known.
- The representation and learning algorithms used to create a linear regression model.
- How to best prepare your data when modeling using linear regression.

Letâ€™s get started.
