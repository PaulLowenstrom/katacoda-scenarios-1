Logistic regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms for binary classification.
This is because it is a simple algorithm that performs very well on a wide range of problems. In
this chapter you are going to discover the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification,
step-by-step. After reading this chapter you will know:
- How to calculate the logistic function.
- How to learn the coefficients for a logistic regression model using stochastic gradient
descent.
- How to make predictions using a logistic regression model.
Letâ€™s get started.
