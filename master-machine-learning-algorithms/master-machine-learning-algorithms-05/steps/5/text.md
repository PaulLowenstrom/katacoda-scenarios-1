Letâ€™s start off by assigning 0.0 to each coefficient and calculating the probability of the first
training instance that belongs to class 0.

```
B0 = 0.0
B1 = 0.0
B2 = 0.0
```

The first training instance is: X1 = 2.7810836, X2 = 2.550537003, Y = 0. Using the above
equation we can plug in all of these numbers and calculate a prediction:
