In this tutorial we will use a contrived dataset. This dataset has two input variables (X1 and
X2) and one output variable (Y ). The input variables are real-valued random numbers drawn
from a Gaussian distribution. The output variable has two values, making the problem a binary
classification problem. The raw data is listed below.

Below is a plot of the dataset. You can see that it is completely contrived and that we can
easily draw a line to separate the classes. This is exactly what we are going to do with the
logistic regression model.
