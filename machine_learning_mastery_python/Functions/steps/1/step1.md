## Functions
The biggest gotcha with Python is the whitespace. Ensure that you have an empty new line after indented code. The example below defines a new function to calculate the sum of two values and calls the function with two arguments.

`def mysum(x, y):
	return x + y 

result = mysum(1, 3)
print(result)`{{execute}}
