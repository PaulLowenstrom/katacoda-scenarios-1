Once you have chosen a machine learning algorithm, you can configure it Configuration is
optional, but highly recommended Weka cleverly chooses sensible defaults for each machine
learning algorithm meaning that you can select an algorithm and start using it immediately
without knowing much about it To get the best results from an algorithm, you should configure
it to behave ideally for your problem How do you configure an algorithm for your problem?

Again, this is another open question and not knowable beforehand Given algorithms do
have heuristics that can guide you but they are not a silver bullet The true answer is to
systematically test a suite of standard configurations for a given algorithm on your problem
You can configure a machine learning algorithm in Weka by clicking on itâ€™s name after you
have selected it This will launch a window that displays all of the configuration details for the
algorithm
