You can learn more about the meaning of each configuration option by hovering your mouse
over each option which will display a tooltip describing the configuration option Some options
give you a limited set of values to choose from, other take integer or real valued numbers Try
both experimentation and research in order to come up with 3-to-5 standard configurations of
an algorithm to try on your problem.

A pro-tip that you can use is to save your standard algorithm configurations to a file Click
the Save button at the bottom of the algorithm configuration Enter a filename that clearly labels
the algorithm name and the type of configuration you are saving You can load an algorithm
configuration later in the Weka Explorer, the Weka Experiment Environment and elsewhere in
Weka This is most valuable when you settle on a suite of standard algorithm configurations
that you want reuse on problem to problem You can adopt and use the configuration for the
algorithm by clicking the OK button on the algorithm configuration window
