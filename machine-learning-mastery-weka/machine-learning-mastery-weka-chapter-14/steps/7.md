#### Linear Machine Learning Algorithms

Linear algorithms assume that the predicted attribute is a linear combination of the input
attributes
- **Linear Regression:** functionLinearRegression
- **Logistic Regression:** functionLogistic

#### Nonlinear Machine Learning Algorithms

Nonlinear algorithms do not make strong assumptions about the relationship between the input
attributes and the output attribute being predicted
- **Naive Bayes:** bayesNaiveBayes
- **Decision Tree (specifically the C45 variety):** treesJ48
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (also called KNN:)** lazyIBk
- **Support Vector Machines (also called SVM):** functionsSMO
- **Neural Network:** functionsMultilayerPerceptron
