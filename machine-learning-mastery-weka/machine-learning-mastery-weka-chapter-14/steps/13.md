In this lesson you discovered the support for machine learning algorithms in the Weka machine
learning workbench Specifically, you learned:
- That Weka has a large selection of machine learning algorithms to choose from for
classification and regression problems
- That you can easily configure each machine learning algorithm and save and load a set of
standard configurations
- That you can dive deeper into the details of a given algorithm and even discover the source
from which it was based in order to learn how to get the best performance

#### Next
Once you can create models from your data with machine learning algorithms, you need to
compare the performance of different models In the next lesson you will learn about the various
different test options that you can use to compare models on your dataset
