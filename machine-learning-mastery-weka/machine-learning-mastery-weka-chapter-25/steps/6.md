Review the details about the dataset in the Current relation pane We can notice a few things:
- The dataset is called housing
- There are 506 instances If we use 10-fold cross-validation later to evaluate the algorithms,
then each fold will be comprised of about 50 instances, which is fine
- There are 14 attributes, 13 inputs and 1 output variable
- Click on each attribute in the Attributes pane and review the summary statistics in the
Selected attribute pane

We can notice a few facts about our data:

- There are no missing values for any of the attributes
- All inputs are numeric except one binary attribute, and have values in differing ranges
- The last attribute is the output variable called class, it is numeric

We may see some benefit from either normalizing or standardizing the data
