In this project you discovered how to work through a regression machine learning problem using
the Weka machine learning workbench Specifically, you learned
- How to load, analysis and prepare views of your dataset in Weka
- How to evaluate a suite of regression machine learning algorithms using the Weka Experiment Environment
- How to tune well performing models and investigate related ensemble methods in order to
lift performance

#### Next
This was your final project and concludes Part III of the book Next, in Part IV we conclude
this book and start off by taking a look at how far you have come
