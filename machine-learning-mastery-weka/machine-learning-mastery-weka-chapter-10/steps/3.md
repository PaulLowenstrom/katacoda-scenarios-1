Weka provides filters for transforming your dataset The best way to see what filters are
supported and to play with them on your dataset is to use the Weka Explorer The Filter pane
allows you to choose a filter

Filters are divided into two types:
- **Supervised Filters:** That can be applied but require user control in some way Such as
rebalancing instances for a class
- **Unsupervised Filters:** That can be applied in an undirected manner For example,
rescale all values to the range 0-to-1

Personally, I think the distinction between these two types of filters is a little arbitrary and
confusing Nevertheless, that is how they are laid out Within these two groups, filters are
further divided into filters for Attributes and Instances:
- **Attribute Filters:** Apply an operation on attributes or one attribute at a time
- **Instance Filters:** Apply an operation on instance or one instance at a time
