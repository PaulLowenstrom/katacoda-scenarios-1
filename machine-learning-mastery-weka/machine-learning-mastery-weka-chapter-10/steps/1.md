Machine learning algorithms make assumptions about the dataset you are modeling Often,
raw data is comprised of attributes with varying scales For example, one attribute may be in
kilograms and another may be a count Although not required, you can often get a boost in
performance by carefully choosing methods to rescale your data In this lesson you will discover
how you can rescale your data so that all of the data has the same scale After reading this
lesson you will know:
- How to normalize your numeric attributes between the range of 0 and 1
- How to standardize your numeric attributes to have a zero mean and unit variance
- When to choose normalization or standardization

Letâ€™s get started
