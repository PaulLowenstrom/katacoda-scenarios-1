Reviewing the details of each attribute in the Selected attribute window will give you
confidence that the filter was successful and that each attribute was rescaled to the range of 0
to 1

You can use other scales such as -1 to 1, which is useful when using Support Vector Machines
and AdaBoost Normalization is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm

you are using does not make assumptions about the distribution of your data, such as k -Nearest
Neighbors and Artificial Neural Networks
