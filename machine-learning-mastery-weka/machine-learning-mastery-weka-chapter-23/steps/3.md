This tutorial will gently walk you through the key steps required to complete a machine learning
project We will work through the following process:
- Load the dataset
- Analyze the dataset
- Evaluate algorithms
- Present results

You can use this as a template for the minimum steps in the process to work through your
own machine learning project using Weka
