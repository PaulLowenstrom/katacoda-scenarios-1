In this lesson you discovered the importance of feature selection and how to use feature selection
on your data with Weka Specifically, you learned:
- How to perform feature selection using correlation
- How to perform feature selection using information gain
- How to perform feature selection by training a model on different subsets of features

#### Next
This concludes our lessons working with data Next you will take a look at the machine learning
algorithm supported by Weka and how the Weka platform letâ€™s you configure and manage
algorithms
