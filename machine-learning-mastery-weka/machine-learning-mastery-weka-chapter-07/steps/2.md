Machine learning algorithms are primarily designed to work with arrays of numbers This is
called tabular or structured data because it is how data looks in a spreadsheet, comprised of
rows and columns Weka has a specific computer science centric vocabulary when describing
data:
- **Instance:** A row of data is called an instance, as in an instance or observation from the
problem domain
- **Attribute:** A column of data is called a feature or attribute, as in feature of the
observation

Each attribute can have a different type, for example:
- **Real** for numeric values like 12
- **Integer** for numeric values without a fractional part like 5
- **Nominal** for categorical data like dog and cat
- **String** for lists of words, like this sentence

On classification problems, the output variable must be nominal For regression problems,
the output variable must be real
