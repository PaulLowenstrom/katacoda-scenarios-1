In this lesson you have discovered how to calculate a baseline performance for your machine
learning problems using Weka Specifically, you learned:
- The importance of calculating a baseline of performance on your problem
- How to calculate a baseline performance for a regression problem using the Zero Rule
algorithm
- How to calculate a baseline performance for a classification problem using the Zero Rule
algorithm

#### Next
Classification may be the most studied form of predictive modeling and Weka has more
classification algorithms than any other type of algorithm In the next lesson you will learn
about 5 top classification algorithms that you can use on your problems
