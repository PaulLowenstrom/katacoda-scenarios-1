What algorithm should you use for a given machine learning problem? This is the challenge
of applied machine learning There is no quick answer to this question, but there is a reliable
process that you can use In this lesson you will discover how to find good and even best
machine learning algorithms for a data set by directly comparing them in Weka After reading
this lesson you will know:
- The process for discovering good and even best machine learning algorithms for a problem
- How to design an experiment in Weka to compare the performance of different machine
learning algorithms
- How to analyze the results of experiments in Weka

Letâ€™s get started
