The Weka workbench provides two main ways to work on your problem: The Explorer for playing
around and trying things out and the Experiment Environment for controlled experiments.

#### Weka Explorer
The explorer is where you play around with your data and think about what transforms to
apply to your data, what algorithms you want to run as experiments. The Explorer interface is
divided into 5 different tabs:
- **Preprocess:** Load a dataset and manipulate the data into a form that you want to work
with.
- **Classify:** Select and run classification and regression algorithms to operate on your data.
- **Cluster:** Select and run clustering algorithms on your dataset.
- **Associate:** Run association algorithms to extract insights from your data.
- **Select Attributes:** Run attribute selection algorithms on your data to select those
attributes that are relevant to the feature you want to predict.
- **Visualize:** Visualize the relationship between attributes.
