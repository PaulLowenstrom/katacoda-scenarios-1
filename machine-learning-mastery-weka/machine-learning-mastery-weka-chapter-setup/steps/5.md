The main reason Weka is so good for beginners is that you can work through the process
of applied machine learning using the graphical interface without having to write a single
line of code. This is a big deal because getting a handle on the process, handling data and
experimenting with algorithms is what a beginner should be learning about, not learning yet
another scripting language. Here are some additional reasons:

- It provides a simple graphical user interface that encapsulates the process of applied machine learning.
- It facilitates algorithm and dataset exploration as well as rigorous experiment design and analysis.
- It is free and open source, meaning you can download it and start using it now.
- It is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, meaning it will run on whatever environment youâ€™re using.
- It contains state-of-the-art algorithms with an impressive list of Decision Trees, Rule-Based Algorithms and Ensemble methods, as well as others.
