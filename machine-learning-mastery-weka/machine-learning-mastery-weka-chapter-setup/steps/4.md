This interface is for designing experiments with your selection of algorithms and datasets,
running experiments and analyzing the results. The tools for analyzing results are powerful,
allowing you to consider and compare results that are statistically significant over multiple runs.

The Experiment interface is divided into 3 different tabs:
- Setup for designing your controlled experiments.
- Run for executing your experiments.
- Analyse for analyzing the results from your experiments.

We will take a tour of the Weka interface in Chapter 6 where you will get to use each tool
for the first time, before we start making heavy use of them in later
