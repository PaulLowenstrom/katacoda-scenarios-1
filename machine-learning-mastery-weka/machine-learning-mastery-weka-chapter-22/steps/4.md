Perhaps the most neglected task in a machine learning project is how to finalize your model
Once you have gone through all of the effort to prepare your data, compare algorithms and tune
them on your problem, you actually need to create the final model that you intend to use to
make new predictions Finalizing a model involves training the model on the entire training
dataset that you have available
- Open the Weka GUI Chooser
- Click the Explorer button to open the Weka Explorer interface
- Load the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset from the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff file

- Click the Classify tab to open up the classifiers
- Click the Choose button and choose Logistic under the functions group
- Select Use training set under Test options
- Click the Start button

This will train the chosen Logistic regression algorithm on the entire loaded dataset It will
also evaluate the model on the entire dataset, but we are not interested in this evaluation It is
assumed that you have already estimated the performance of the model on unseen data using
cross-validation as a part of selecting the algorithm you wish to finalize It is this estimate you
prepared previously that you can report when you need to inform others about the skill of your
model Now that we have finalized the model, we need to save it to file
