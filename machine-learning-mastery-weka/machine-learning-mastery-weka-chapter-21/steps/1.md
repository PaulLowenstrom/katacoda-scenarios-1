You can get the most from a machine learning algorithm by tuning its parameters, called
hyperparameters In this lesson you will discover how to tune machine learning algorithms with
controlled experiments in Weka After reading this lesson you will know:
- The importance of improving the performance of machine learning models by algorithm
tuning
- How to design a controlled experiment to tune the hyperparameters of a machine learning
algorithm
- How to interpret the results from tuning an experiment using statistical significance

Letâ€™s get started
