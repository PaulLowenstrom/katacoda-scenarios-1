In this lesson you discovered how to use top classification machine learning algorithms in Weka
Specifically, you learned:
- top classification algorithms you can try on your own problems
- The key configuration parameters to tune for each algorithm
- How to use each algorithm in Weka

#### Next
There are a lot of machine learning algorithms to choose from In the next lesson you will learn
about 5 top algorithms that you can use on regression problems
