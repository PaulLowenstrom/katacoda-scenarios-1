Often your raw data foachine learning is not in an ideal form for modeling You need to
prepare or reshape it to meet the expectations of different machine learning algorithms In this
lesson you will discover two techniques that you can use to transform your machine learning
data ready for modeling After reading this lesson you will know:
- How to convert a real valued attribute into a discrete distribution called discretization
- How to convert a discrete attribute into multiple real values called dummy variables
- When to discretize or create dummy variables from your data

Letâ€™s get started
