In this lesson you discovered how to transform your machine learning data to meet the expectations of different machine learning algorithms Specifically, you learned:
- How to convert real valued input attributes to nominal attributes called discretization
- How to convert a categorical input variable to multiple binary input attributes called
dummy variables
- When to use discretization and dummy variables when modeling data

#### Next
Raw data is often not suitable for modeling directly It may need to be cleaned first In the next
lesson you will learn how to identify, mark, remove and impute missing values in your dataset
