Data is rarely clean and often you can have corrupt or missing values It is important to identify,
mark and handle missing data when developing machine learning models in order to get the
very best performance In this lesson you will discover how to handle missing values in your
machine learning data using Weka After reading this lesson you will know:
- How to mark missing values in your dataset
- How to remove data with missing values from your dataset
- How to impute missing values

Letâ€™s get started
