In this lesson you discovered the Weka Machine Learning Workbench. You went on a tour of
the key interfaces that you can use to explore and develop predictive machine learning models
on your own problems. Specifically, you learned about:
- The Weka Explorer for data preparation, feature selection and evaluating algorithms.
- The Weka Experiment Environment for designing, running and analyzing the results from
controlled experiments.
- The Weka KnowledgeFlow Environment for graphically designing and executing machine
learning pipelines.
- The Weka Workbench that incorporates all of the Weka tools into a single convenient
interface.
- The Weka SimpleCLI for using the Weka API from the command line.
- The Weka Java API that can be used to incorporate learning and prediction into your
own applications.

We are now familiar with the Weka interface. In the next lesson we will learn how to load
machine learning data in CSV format into Weka.
