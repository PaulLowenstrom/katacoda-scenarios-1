The Weka Explorer is designed to investigate your machine learning dataset. It is useful when
you are thinking about different data transforms and modeling algorithms that you could
investigate with a controlled experiment later. It is excellent for getting ideas and playing
what-if scenarios. The interface is divided into 6 tabs, each with a specific function:
The Preprocess tab is for loading your dataset and applying filters to transform the data
into a form that better exposes the structure of the problem to the modeling processes. Also
provides some summary statistics about loaded data. Load a standard dataset in the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/
directory of your Weka installation, specifically /root/Desktop/weka/examples/breast-cancer.arff. This is a binary
classification problem that we will use on this tour.

The Classify tab is for training and evaluating the performance of different machine learning
algorithms on your classification or regression problem. Algorithms are divided up into groups,
results are kept in a result list and summarized in the main Classifier output pane.
- Click the Start button to run the ZeroR classifier on the dataset and summarize the
results.

The Cluster tab is for training and evaluating the performance of different unsupervised
clustering algorithms on your unlabeled dataset. Like the Classify tab, algorithms are divided
into groups, results are kept in a result list and summarized in the main Clusterer output pane.
- Click the Start button to run the EM clustering algorithm on the dataset and summarize
the results.
