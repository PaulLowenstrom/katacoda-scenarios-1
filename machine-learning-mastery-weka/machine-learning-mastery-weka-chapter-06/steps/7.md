The Weka KnowledgeFlow Environment is a graphical workflow tool for designing a machine
learning pipeline from data source to results summary, and much more. Once designed, the
pipeline can be executed and evaluated within the tool.

The Weka KnowledgeFlow Environment is a powerful tool that I do not recommend for
beginners until after they have mastered use of the Weka Explorer and Weka Experiment
Environment.

#### Weka Workbench
The Weka Workbench is an environment that combines all of the GUI interfaces into a single
interface. It is useful if you find yourself jumping a lot between two or more different interfaces,
such as between the Weka Explorer and the Weka Experiment Environment. This can happen
if you try out a lot of what-ifâ€™s in the Explorer and quickly take what you learn and put it into
controlled experiments.
