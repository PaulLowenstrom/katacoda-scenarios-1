**Weka SimpleCLI**

Weka can be used from a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). This is powerful because you
can write shell scripts to use the full API from command line calls with parameters, allowing
you to build models, run experiments and make predictions without a graphical user interface.
The Weka SimpleCLI provides an environment where you can quickly and easily experiment
with the Weka command line interface commands.

Like the Weka KnowledgeFlow Environment, this is a powerful tool that I do not recommend
for beginners until they have mastered use of the Weka Explorer and Weka Experiment
Environment.

**Weka Java API**

Weka can also be used from the Java API. This is for Java programmers and can be useful
when you want to incorporate learning or prediction into your own applications. This is an
advanced feature that I do not recommend for beginners until they have mastered use of the
Weka Explorer and Weka Experiment Environment.
