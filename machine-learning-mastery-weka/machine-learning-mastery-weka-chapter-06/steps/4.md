The Associate tab is for automatically finding associations in a dataset. The techniques are
often used for market basket analysis type data mining problems and require data where all
attributes are categorical.
- Click the Start button to run the Apriori association algorithm on the dataset and
summarize the results.

The Select attributes tab is for performing feature selection on the loaded dataset and
identifying those features that are most likely to be relevant in developing a predictive model.
- Click the Start button to run the CfsSubsetEval algorithm with a BestFirst search on the

The Visualize tab is for reviewing pairwise scatter plot matrix of each attribute plotted
against every other attribute in the loaded dataset. It is useful to get an idea of the shape and
relationship of attributes that may aid in data filtering, transformation and modeling.
- Increase the PointSize and the Jitter and click the Update button to set an improved plot
of the categorical attributes of the loaded dataset.
