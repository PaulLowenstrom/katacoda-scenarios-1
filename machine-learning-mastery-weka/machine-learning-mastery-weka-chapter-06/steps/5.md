The Weka Experiment Environment is for designing controlled experiments, running them, then
analyzing the results collected. It is the next step after using the Weka Explorer, where you can
load up one or more views of your dataset and a suite of algorithms and design an experiment
to find the combination that results in the best performance. The interface is split into 3 tabs.
The Setup tab is for designing an experiment. This includes the file where results are
written, the test setup in terms of how algorithms are evaluated, the datasets to model and
the algorithms to model them. The specifics of an experiment can be saved for later use and
modification. In this section we will use the onset of diabetes binary classification problem.

- Click the New button to create a new experiment.
- Click the Add New... button in the Datasets pane and select the /root/Desktop/weka/examples/diabetes.arff
dataset.
- Click the Add New... button in the Algorithms pane and click OK to add the ZeroR
algorithm.
