The problem of predictive modeling is to create models that have good performance making
predictions on new unseen data Therefore it is important to use robust techniques to train
and evaluate your models on your available training data The more reliable the estimate of
the performance on your model, the further you can push the performance and be confident it
will translate to the operational use of your model In this lesson you will discover the various
different ways that you can estimate the performance of your machine learning models in Weka
After reading this lesson you will know:
- How to evaluate your model using the training dataset
- How to evaluate your model using a random train and test split
- How to evaluate your model using k -fold cross-validation
