Test options are concerned with estimating the performance of a model on unseen data This is
an important concept to internalize The goal of predictive modeling is to create a model that
performs best in a situation that we do not fully understand, the future with new unknown
data We must use these powerful statistical techniques to best estimate the performance of the
model in this situation.

That being said, once we have chosen a model, it must be finalized None of these test
options are used for this purpose The model must be trained on the entire training dataset
and saved This topic of model finalization is beyond the scope of this lesson Just note, that
the performance of the finalized model does not need to be calculated, it is estimated using the
test option techniques discussed above
