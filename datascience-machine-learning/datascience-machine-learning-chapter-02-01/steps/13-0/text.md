I'm going to give you a little assignment in this section. If you open up `MeanMedianExercise.ipynb` file, there's some stuff you can play with. I want you to roll up your sleeves and actually try to do this.

You can open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/MeanMedianExercise.ipynb

In the file, we have some random e-commerce data. What this data represents is the total amount spent per transaction, and again, just like with our previous example, it's just a normal distribution of data. We can run that, and your homework is to go ahead and find the mean and median of this data using the NumPy package. Pretty much the easiest assignment you could possibly imagine. All the techniques you need are in the `MeanMedianMode.ipynb` file that we used earlier.

The point here is not really to challenge you, it's just to make you actually write some Python code and convince yourself that you can actually get a result and make something happen here. So, go ahead and play with that. If you want to play with it some more, feel free to play around with the data distribution here and see what effect you can have on the numbers. Try adding some outliers, kind of like we did with the income data. This is the way to learn this stuff: master the basics and the advance stuff will follow. Have at it, have fun.

Once your're ready, let's move forward to our next concept, standard deviation and variance.
