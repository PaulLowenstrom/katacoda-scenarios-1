So we've already seen some examples of a normal distribution function for some of the examples in this book. That's an example of a probability density function, and there are other types of probability density functions out there. So let's dive in and see what it really means and what some other examples of them are.

#### The probability density function and probability mass functions
We've already seen some examples of a normal distribution function for some of the code we've looked at in this book. That's an example of a probability density function, and there are other types of probability density functions out there. Let's dive in and see what that really means and what some other examples of them there are.
