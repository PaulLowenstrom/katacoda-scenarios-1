Let's start doing some real coding in Python and see how you compute the mean, median, and mode using Python in an IPython Notebook file.

So go ahead and open up the `MeanMedianMode.ipynb` file from the data files for this section if you'd like to follow along, which I definitely encourage you to do. If you need to go back to that earlier section on where to download these materials from, please go do that, because you will need these files for the section. Let's dive in!


#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for notebooks. Open and run `MeanMedianMode.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/MeanMedianMode.ipynb
