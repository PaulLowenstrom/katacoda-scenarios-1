**Categorical data**

The second type of data that we're going to talk about is categorical data, and this is data that has no inherent numeric meaning.

Most of the time, you can't really compare one category to another directly. Things like gender, yes/no questions, race, state of residence, product category, political party; you can assign numbers to these categories, and often you will, but those numbers have no inherent meaning.


So, for example, I can say that the area of Texas is greater than the area of Florida, but I can't just say Texas is greater than Florida, they're just categories. There's no real numerical quantifiable meaning to them, it's just ways that we categorize different things.

Now again, I might have some sort of numerical assignation to each state. I mean, I could say that Florida is state number 3 and Texas state number 4, but there's no real relationship between 3 and 4 there, right, it's just a shorthand to more compactly represent these categories. So again, categorical data does not have any intrinsic numerical meaning; it's just a way that you're choosing to split up a set of data based on categories.

**Ordinal data**

The last category that you tend to hear about with types of data is ordinal data, and it's sort of a mixture of numerical and categorical data. A common example is star ratings for a movie or music, or what have you.


In this case, we have categorical data in that could be 1 through 5 stars, where 1 might represent poor and 5 might represent excellent, but they do have mathematical meaning. We do know that 5 means it's better than a 1, so this is a case where we have data where the different categories have a numerical relationship to each other. So, I can say that 1 star is less than 5 stars, I can say that 2 stars is less than 3 stars, I can say that 4 stars is greater than 2 stars in terms of a measure of quality. Now you could also think of the actual number of stars as discrete numerical data. So, it's definitely a fine line between these categories, and in a lot of cases you can actually treat them interchangeably.

So, there you have it, the three different types. There is numerical, categorical, and ordinal data. Let's see if it's sunk in. Don't worry, I'm not going to make you hand in your work or anything.
