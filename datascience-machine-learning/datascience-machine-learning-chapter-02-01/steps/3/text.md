**Numerical data**

Let's start with numerical data. It's probably the most common data type. Basically, it represents some quantifiable thing that you can measure. Some examples are heights of people, page load times, stock prices, and so on. Things that vary, things that you can measure, things that have a wide range of possibilities. Now there are basically two kinds of numerical data, so a flavor of a flavor if you will.

**Discrete data**

There's discrete data, which is integer-based and, for example, can be counts of some sort of event. Some examples are how many purchases did a customer make in a year. Well, that can only be discrete values. They bought one thing, or they bought two things, or they bought three things. They couldn't have bought, 2.25 things or three and three-quarters things. It's a discrete value that has an integer restriction to it.

**Continuous data**

The other type of numerical data is continuous data, and this is stuff that has an infinite range of possibilities where you can go into fractions. So, for example, going back to the height of people, there is an infinite number of possible heights for people. You could be five feet and 10.37625 inches tall, or the time it takes to do something like check out on a website could be any huge range of possibilities, 10.7625 seconds for all you know, or how much rainfall in a given day. Again, there's an infinite amount of precision there. So that's an example of continuous data.

To recap, numerical data is something you can measure quantitatively with a number, and it can be either discrete, where it's integer-based like an event count, or continuous, where you can have an infinite range of precision available to that data.
