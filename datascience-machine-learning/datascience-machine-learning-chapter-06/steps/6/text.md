Let's now try to address some of the shortcomings in user-based collaborative filtering with a technique called item-based collaborative filtering, and we'll see how that can be more powerful. It's actually one of the techniques that Amazon uses under the hood, and they've talked about this publicly so I can tell you that much, but let's see why it's such a great idea. With user-based collaborative filtering we base our recommendations on relationships between people, but what if we flip that and base them on relationships between items? That's what item-based collaborative filtering is.

**Understanding item-based collaborative filtering**

This is going to draw on a few insights. For one thing, we talked about people being fickle-their tastes can change over time, so comparing one person to another person based on their past behavior becomes pretty complicated. People have different phases where they have different interests, and you might not be comparing the people that are in the same phase to each other. But, an item will always be whatever it is. A movie will always be a movie, it's never going to change. Star Wars will always be Star Wars, well until George Lucas tinkers with it a little bit, but for the most part, items do not change as much as people do. So, we know that these relationships are more permanent, and there's more of a direct comparison you can make when computing similarity between items, because they do not change over time.
