In this scenario, we get into machine learning and how to actually implement machine learning models in Python.

We'll walk through the fascinating concepts of ensemble learning and SVMs, which are some of my favourite machine learning areas!

More specifically, we'll cover the following topics:

- Concept of decision trees and its example in Python
- What is ensemble learning
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) and its example using scikit-learn
