Let's try out some support vector machines here. Fortunately, it's a lot easier to use than it is to understand. We're going to go back to the same example I used for k-means clustering, where I'm going to create some fabricated cluster data about ages and incomes of a hundred random people.

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several notebooks. Open and run `SVC.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/SVC.ipynb
