Let's nail that example home a little bit more.

Again, a drug test can be a common example of applying Bayes' theorem to prove a point. Even a highly accurate drug test can produce more false positives than true positives. So in our example here, we're going to come up with a drug test that can accurately identify users of a drug 99% of the time and accurately has a negative result for 99% of non-users, but only 0.3% of the overall population actually uses the drug in question. So we have a very small probability of actually being a user of a drug. What seems like a very high accuracy of 99% isn't actually high enough, right?

We can work out the math as follows:

- Event A = is a user of the drug
- Event B = tested positively for the drug

So let event A mean that you're a user of some drug, and event B the event that you tested positively for the drug using this drug test.
