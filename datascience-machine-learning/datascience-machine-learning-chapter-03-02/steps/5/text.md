Alright, let's move on and do another more complicated example using some real Python code. We can then see how we might actually implement these ideas using Python.

Let's put conditional probability into action here and use some of the ideas to figure out if there's a relationship between age and buying stuff using some fabricated data. Go ahead and open up the `ConditionalProbabilityExercise.ipynb` here and follow along with me if you like.

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several notebooks. Open and run `ConditionalProbabilityExercise.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/ConditionalProbabilityExercise.ipynb
