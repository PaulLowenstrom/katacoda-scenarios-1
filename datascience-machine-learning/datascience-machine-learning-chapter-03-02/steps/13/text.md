One common example is drug testing. We might say, what's the probability of being an actual user of a drug given that you tested positive for it. The reason Bayes' theorem is important is that it calls out that this very much depends on both the probability of A and the probability of B. The probability of being a drug user given that you tested positive depends very much on the base overall probability of being a drug user and the overall probability of testing positive. The probability of a drug test being accurate depends a lot on the overall probability of being a drug user in the population, not just the accuracy of the test.

It also means that the probability of B given A is not the same thing as the probability of A given B. That is, the probability of being a drug user given that you tested positive can be very different from the probability of testing positive given that you're a drug user. You can see where this is going. That is a very real problem where diagnostic tests in medicine or drug tests yield a lot of false positives. You can still say that the probability of a test detecting a user can be very high, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the probability of being a user given that you tested positive is high. Those are two different things, and Bayes' theorem allows you to quantify that difference.
