What I'm trying to find out with conditional probability is if I have two events that depend on each other. That is, what's the probability that both will occur?

In mathematical notation, the way we indicate things here is that P(A,B) represents the probability of both A and B occurring independent of each other. That is, what's the probability of both of these things happening irrespective of everything else.

Whereas this notation, P(B|A), is read as the probability of B given A. So, what is the probability of B given that event A has already occurred? It's a little bit different, and these things are related like this:
