**Note:**
Even though P(B|A) is high (99%), it doesn't mean P(A|B) is high.

People overlook this all the time, so if there's one lesson to be learned from Bayes' theorem, it is to always take these sorts of things with a grain of salt. Apply Bayes' theorem to these actual problems and you'll often find that what sounds like a high accuracy rate can actually be yielding very misleading results if you're dealing with a low overall incidence of a given problem. We see the same thing in cancer screening and other sorts of medical screening as well. That's a very real problem; there's a lot of people getting very, very real and very unnecessary surgery as a result of not understanding Bayes' theorem. If you're going into the medical profession with big data, please, please, please remember this theorem.

So that's Bayes' theorem. Always remember that the probability of something given something else is not the same thing as the other way around, and it actually depends a lot on the base probabilities of both of those two things that you're measuring. It's a very important thing to keep in mind, and always look at your results with that in mind. Bayes' theorem gives you the tools to quantify that effect. I hope it proves useful.
