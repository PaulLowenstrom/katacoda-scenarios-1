In this scenario, we get into machine learning and how to actually implement machine learning models in Python.

We'll also cover a really interesting application of machine learning called decision trees and we'll build a working example in Python that predict shiring decisions in a company. Finally, we'll walk through the fascinating concepts of ensemble learning and SVMs, which are some of my favourite machine learning areas!

More specifically, we'll cover the following topics:

- Concept of K-means clustering
- Example of clustering in Python
- Entropy and how to measure it
