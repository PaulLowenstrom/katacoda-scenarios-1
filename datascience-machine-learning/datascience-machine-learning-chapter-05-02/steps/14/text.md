Believe it or not, given a set of training data, you can actually get Python to generate a flowchart for you to make a decision. So if you have something you're trying to predict on some classification, you can use a decision tree to actually look at multiple attributes that you can decide upon at each level in the flowchart. You can print out an actual flowchart for you to use to make a decision from, based on actual machine learning. How cool is that? Let's see how it works.

I personally find decision trees are one of the most interesting applications of machine learning. A decision tree basically gives you a flowchart of how to make some decision.You have some dependent variable, like whether or not I should go play outside today or not based on the weather. When you have a decision like that that depends on multiple attributes or multiple variables, a decision tree could be a good choice.

There are many different aspects of the weather that might influence my decision of whether I should go outside and play. It might have to do with the humidity, the temperature, whether it's sunny or not, for example. A decision tree can look at all these different attributes of the weather, or anything else, and decide what are the thresholds? What are the decisions I need to make on each one of those attributes before I arrive at a decision of whether or not I should go play outside? That's all a decision tree is. So it's a form of supervised learning.
