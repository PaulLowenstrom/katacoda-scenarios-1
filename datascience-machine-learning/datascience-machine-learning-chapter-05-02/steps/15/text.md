The way it would work in this example would be as follows. I would have some sort of dataset of historical weather, and data about whether or not people went outside to play on a particular day. I would feed the model this data of whether it was sunny or not on each day, what the humidity was, and if it was windy or not; and whether or not it was a good day to go play outside. Given that training data, a decision tree algorithm can then arrive at a tree that gives us a flowchart that we can print out. It looks just like the following flow chart. You can just walk through and figure out whether or not it's a good day to play outside based on the current attributes. You can use that to predict the decision for a new set of values:

How cool is that? We have an algorithm that will make a flowchart for you automatically just based on observational data. What's even cooler is how simple it all works once you learn how it works.
