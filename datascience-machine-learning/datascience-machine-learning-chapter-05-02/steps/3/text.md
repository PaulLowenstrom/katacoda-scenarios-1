Next, we're going to talk about k-means clustering, and this is an unsupervised learning technique where you have a collection of stuff that you want to group together into various clusters. Maybe it's movie genres or demographics of people, who knows? But it's actually a pretty simple idea, so let's see how it works.

K-means clustering is a very common technique in machine learning where you just try to take a bunch of data and find interesting clusters of things just based on the attributes of the data itself. Sounds fancy, but it's actually pretty simple. All we do in k-means clustering is try to split our data into K groups - that's where the K comes from, it's how many different groups you're trying to split your data into - and it does this by finding K centroids.

So, basically, what group a given data point belongs to is defined by which of these centroid points it's closest to in your scatter plot. You can visualize this in the following image:

This is showing an example of k-means clustering with K of three, and the squares represent data points in a scatter plot. The circles represent the centroids that the k-means clustering algorithm came up with, and each point is assigned a cluster based on which centroid it's closest to. So that's all there is to it, really. It's an example of unsupervised learning. It isn't a case where we have a bunch of data and we already know the correct cluster for a given set of training data; rather, you're just given the data itself and it tries to converge on these clusters naturally just based on the attributes of the data alone. It's also an example where you are trying to find clusters or categorizations that you didn't even know were there. As with most unsupervised learning techniques, the point is to find latent values, things you didn't really realize were there until the algorithm showed them to you.
