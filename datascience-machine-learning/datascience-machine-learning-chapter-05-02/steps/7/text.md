Let's see just how easy it is to do k-means clustering using scikit-learn and Python.

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several notebooks. Open and run `KMeans.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/KMeans.ipynb

We will discuss notebook in the next steps.
