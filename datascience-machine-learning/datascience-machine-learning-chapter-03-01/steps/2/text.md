Your data is only as good as you can present it to other people, really, so let's talk about plotting and graphing your data and how to present it to others and make your graphs look pretty. We're going to introduce Matplotlib more thoroughly and put it through its paces.

I'll show you a few tricks on how to make your graphs as pretty as you can. Let's have some fun with graphs. It's always good to make pretty pictures out of your work. This will give you some more tools in your tool chest for visualizing different types of data using different types of graphs and making it look pretty. We'll use different colors, different line styles, different axes, things like that. It's not only important to use graphs and data visualization to try to find interesting patterns in your data, but it's also interesting to present your findings well to a non-technical audience. Without further ado, let's dive in to Matplotlib.
