Correlation normalizes everything by the standard deviation of each attribute (just divide the covariance by the standard deviations of both variables and that normalizes things). By doing so, I can say very clearly that a correlation of -1 means there's a perfect inverse correlation, so as one value increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. A correlation of 0 means there's no correlation at all between these two sets of attributes. A correlation of 1 would imply perfect correlation, where these two attributes are moving in exactly the same way as you look at different data points.

**Note:**

Remember, correlation does not imply causation. Just because you find a very high correlation value does not mean that one of these attributes causes the other. It just means there's a relationship between the two, and that relationship could be caused by something completely different. The only way to really determine causation is through a controlled experiment, which we'll talk about more later.
