Alright, if you want to mess with this some more you can solve that feed problem. Go ahead and strip out things that include feed because we know that's not a real web page, just to get some familiarity with the code. Or, go look at the log a little bit more closely, gain some understanding as to where those feed pages are actually coming from.

Maybe there's an even better and more robust way of identifying that traffic as a larger class. So, feel free to mess around with that. But I hope you learned your lesson: data cleaning - hugely important and it's going to take a lot of your time!

So, it's pretty surprising how hard it was to get some reasonable results on a simple question like "What are the top viewed pages on my website?" You can imagine if that much work had to go into cleaning the data for such a simple problem, think about all the nuanced ways that dirty data might actually impact the results of more complex problems, and complex algorithms.

It's very important to understand your source data, look at it, look at a representative sample of it, make sure you understand what's coming into your system. Always question your results and tie it back to the original source data to see where questionable results are coming from.
