If you want to be able to interpret the results you get, sometimes you need to scale them back up to their original range after you're done. If you are scaling things and maybe even biasing them towards a certain amount before you input them into a model, make sure that you unscale them and unbias them before you actually present those results to somebody. Or else they won't make any sense! And just a little reminder, a little bit of a parable if you will, always check to see if you should normalize or whiten your data before you pass it into a given model.

No exercise associated with this section; it's just something I want you to remember. I'm just trying to drive the point home. Some algorithms require whitening, or normalization, some don't. So, always read the documentation! If you do need to normalize the data going into an algorithm it will usually tell you so, and it will make it very easy to do so. Please just be aware of that!
