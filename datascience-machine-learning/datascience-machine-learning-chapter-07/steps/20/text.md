As I go and explore the entire space, I can build up a set of all the possible states that Pac-Man can be in, and the values associated with moving in a given direction in each one of those states, and that's reinforcement learning. And as it explores the whole space, it refines these reward values for a given state, and it can then use those stored reward values to choose the best decision to make given a current set of conditions. In addition to Pac-Man, there's also a game called Cat & Mouse that is an example that's used commonly that we'll look at later.

The benefit of this technique is that once you've explored the entire set of possible states that your agent can be in, you can very quickly have a very good performance when you run different iterations of this. So, you know, you can basically make an intelligent Pac-Man by running reinforcement learning and letting it explore the values of different decisions it can make in different states and then storing that information, to very quickly make the right decision given a future state that it sees in an unknown set of conditions.
