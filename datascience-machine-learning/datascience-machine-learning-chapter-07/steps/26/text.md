I don't know, I think it's pretty cool that you can actually make sort of an artificially intelligent Pac-Man through such a simple technique, and it really does work! If you want to go look at it in more detail, following are a few examples you can look at that have one actual source code you can look at, and potentially play with, Python Markov Decision Process Toolbox: http://pymdptoolbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/mdp.html.

There is a Python Markov decision process toolbox that wraps it up in all that terminology we talked about. There's an example you can look at, a working example of the cat and mouse game, which is similar. And, there is actually a Pac-Man example you can look at online as well, that ties in more directly with what we were talking about. Feel free to explore these links, and learn even more about it.

And so that's reinforcement learning. More generally, it's a useful technique for building an agent that can navigate its way through a possible different set of states that have a set of actions that can be associated with each state. So, we've talked about it mostly in the context of a maze game. But, you can think more broadly, and you know whenever you have a situation where you need to predict behavior of something given a set of current conditions and a set of actions it can take. Reinforcement learning and Q-learning might be a way of doing it. So, keep that in mind!
