So, a very specific implementation of reinforcement learning is called Q-learning, and this formalizes what we just talked about a little bit more:

So, we start off with a Q value of 0 for every possible state that Pac-Man could be in. And, as Pac-Man explores a maze, as bad things happen to Pac-Man, we reduce the Q value for the state that Pac-Man was in at the time. So, if Pac-Man ends up getting eaten by a ghost, we penalize whatever he did in that current state. As good things happen to Pac-Man, as he eats a power pill, or eats a ghost, we'll increase the Q value for that action, for the state that he was in. Then, what we can do is use those Q values to inform Pac-Man's future choices, and sort of build a little intelligent agent that can perform optimally, and make a perfect little Pac-Man. From the same image of Pac-Man that we saw just above, we can further define the current state of Pac-Man by defining that he has a wall to the West, empty space to the North and East, a ghost to the South.

We can look at the actions he can take: he can't actually move left at all, but he can move up, down, or right, and we can assign a value to all those actions. By going up or right, nothing really happens at all, there's no power pill or dots to consume. But if he goes left, that's definitely a negative value. We can say for the state given by the current conditions that Pac-Man is surrounded by, moving down would be a really bad choice; there should be a negative Q value for that. Moving left just can't be done at all. Moving up or right or staying neutral, the Q value would remain 0 for those action choices for that given state.
