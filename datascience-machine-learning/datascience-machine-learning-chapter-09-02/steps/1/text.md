Everyone talks about big data, and odds are you might be working for a company that does in fact have big data to process. Big data meaning that you can't actually control it all, you can't actually wrangle it all on just one system. You need to actually compute it using the resources of an entire cloud, a cluster of computing resources. And that's where Apache Spark comes in. Apache Spark is a very powerful tool for managing big data, and doing machine learning on large Datasets. By the end of the chapter, you will have an in-depth knowledge of the following topics:

- Working with Spark
- Decision Trees in Spark
- K-Means Clustering in Spark
