Now, run the python code by running: `python SparkLinearRegression.py`{{execute}}

There's a little bit more upfront time to actually run these APIs with Datasets, but once they get going, they're very fast. Alright, there you have it.

Here we have our actual and predicted values side by side, and you can see that they're not too bad. They tend to be more or less in the same ballpark. There you have it, a linear regression model in action using Spark 2.0, using the new dataframe-based API for MLlib. More and more, you'll be using these APIs going forward with MLlib in Spark, so make sure you opt for these when you can. Alright, that's MLlib in Spark, a way of actually distributing massive computing tasks across an entire cluster for doing machine learning on big Datasets. So, good skill to have. Let's move on.
