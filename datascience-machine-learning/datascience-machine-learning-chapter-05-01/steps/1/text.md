In this scenario, we get into machine learning and how to actually implement machine learning models in Python.

We'll examine what supervised and unsupervised learning means, and how they're different from each other. We'll see techniques to prevent overfitting, and then look at an interesting example where we implement a spam classifier. We'll analyze what K-Means clustering is a long the way, with a working example that clusters people based on their income and age using scikit-learn!

More specifically, we'll cover the following topics:

- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Avoiding overfitting by using train/test
- Bayesian methods
- Implementation of an e-mail spam classifier with Na√Øve Bayes
