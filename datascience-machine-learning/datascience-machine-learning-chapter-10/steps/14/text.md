Now, if you instead see a flat line or a line that's all over the place, that kind of tells you that that p-value's not going anywhere, and it doesn't matter how long you run this experiment, it's just not going to happen. You need to agree up front that in the case where you're not seeing any trends in p-values, what's the longest you're willing to run this experiment for? Is it two weeks? Is it a month?

**Note:**

Another thing to keep in mind is that having more than one experiment running on the site at once can conflate your results.

Time spent on experiments is a valuable commodity, you can't make more time in the world. You can only really run as many experiments as you have time to run them in a given year. So, if you spend too much time running one experiment that really has no chance of converging on a result, that's an opportunity you've missed to run another potentially more valuable experiment during that time that you are wasting on this other one.

It's important to draw the line on experiment links, because time is a very precious commodity when you're running A/B tests on a website, at least as long as you have more ideas than you have time, which hopefully is the case. Make sure you go in with agreed upper bounds on how long you're going to spend testing a given experiment, and if you're not seeing trends in the p-value that look encouraging, it's time to pull the plug at that point.
