If you work as a data scientist at a web company, you'll probably be asked to spend some time analyzing the results of A/B tests. These are basically controlled experiments on a website to measure the impact of a given change. So, let's talk about what A/B tests are and how they work.

#### A/B tests
If you're going to be a data scientist at a big tech web company, this is something you're going to definitely be involved in, because people need to run experiments to try different things on a website and measure the results of it, and that's actually not as straightforward as most people think it is.

What is an A/B test? Well, it's a controlled experiment that you usually run on a website, it can be applied to other contexts as well, but usually we're talking about a website, and we're going to test the performance of some change to that website, versus the way it was before.

You basically have a control set of people that see the old website, and a test group of people that see the change to the website, and the idea is to measure the difference in behavior between these two groups and use that data to actually decide whether this change was beneficial or not.
