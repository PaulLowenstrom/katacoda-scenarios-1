For example, I own a business that has a website, we license software to people, and right now I have a nice, friendly, orange button that people click on when they want to buy a license as shown on the left in the following figure. But what would happen if I changed the color of that button to blue, as shown on the right?

So in this example, if I want to find out whether blue would be better. How do I know?

I mean, intuitively, maybe that might capture people's attention more, or intuitively, maybe people are more used to seeing orange buy buttons and are more likely to click on that, I could spin that either way, right? So, my own internal biases or preconceptions don't really matter. What matters is how people react to this change on my actual website, and that's what an A/B test does.

A/B testing will split people up into people who see the orange button, and people who see the blue button, and I can then measure the behavior between these two groups and how they might differ, and make my decision on what color my buttons should be based on that data.

You can test all sorts of things with an A/B test. These include:
