How do you know if a change resulting from an A/B test is actually a real result of what you changed, or if it's just random variation? Well, there are a couple of statistical tools at our disposal called the t-test or t-statistic, and the p-value. Let's learn more about what those are and how they can help you determine whether an experiment is good or not.

The aim is to figure out if a result is real or not. Was this just a result of random variance that's inherent in the data itself, or are we seeing an actual, statistically significant change in behavior between our control group and our test group? T-tests and p-values are a way to compute that.

**Note:**

Remember, statistically significant doesn't really have a specific meaning. At the end of the day it has to be a judgment call. You have to pick a probability value that you're going to accept of a result being real or not. But there's always going to be a chance that it's still a result of random variation, and you have to make sure your stakeholders understand that.
