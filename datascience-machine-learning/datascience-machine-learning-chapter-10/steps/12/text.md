How long do you run an experiment for? How long does it take to actually get a result? At what point do you give up? Let's talk about that in more detail.

If someone in your company has developed a new experiment, a new change that they want to test, then they have a vested interest in seeing that succeed. They put a lot of work and time into it, and they want it to be successful. Maybe you've gone weeks with the testing and you still haven't reached a significant outcome on this experiment, positive or negative. You know that they're going to want to keep running it pretty much indefinitely in the hope that it will eventually show a positive result. It's up to you to draw the line on how long you're willing to run this experiment for.

How do I know when I'm done running an A/B test? I mean, it's not always straightforward to predict how long it will take before you can achieve a significant result, but obviously if you have achieved a significant result, if your p-value has gone below 1 percent or 5 percent or whatever threshold you've chosen, and you're done.
