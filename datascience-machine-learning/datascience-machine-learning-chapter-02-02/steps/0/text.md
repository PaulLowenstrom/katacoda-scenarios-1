In this scenario, we are going to go through a few concepts of statistics and probability, which might be a refresher for some of you. These concepts are important to go through if you want to be a data scientist. We will see examples to understand these concepts better. We will also look at how to implement those examples using actual Python code.

We'll be covering the following topics in this scenario:

- Types of data distributions and how to plot them
- Understanding percentiles and moments
