If you want to play around with it, go ahead and, again, try to modify the distribution. Make it centered around something besides 0, and see if that actually changes anything. Should it? Well, it really shouldn't because these are all measures of the shape of the distribution, and it doesn't really say a whole lot about where that distribution is exactly. It's a measure of the shape. That's what the moments are all about. Go ahead and play around with that, try different center values, try different standard deviation values, and see what effect it has on these values, and it doesn't change at all. Of course, you'd expect things like the mean to change because you're changing the mean value, but variance, skew, maybe not. Play around, find out.

There you have percentiles and moments. Percentiles are a pretty simple concept. Moments sound hard, but it's actually pretty easy to understand how to do it, and it's easy in Python too. Now you have that under your belt. It's time to move on.
