Let's look at some real examples of probability distribution functions and data distributions in general and wrap your head a little bit more around data distributions and how to visualize them and use them in Python.

Go ahead and open up the Distributions.ipynb from the book materials, and you can follow along with me here if you'd like.

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for several notebooks. Open and run `Distributions.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/Distributions.ipynb
