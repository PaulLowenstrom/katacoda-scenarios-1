Next, let's talk about moments. Moments are a fancy mathematical phrase, but you don't actually need a math degree to understand it, though. Intuitively, it's a lot simpler than it sounds.

It's one of those examples where people in statistics and data science like to use big fancy terms to make themselves sound really smart, but the concepts are actually very easy to grasp, and that's the theme you're going to hear again and again in this book.

Basically, moments are ways to measure the shape of a data distribution, of a probability density function, or of anything, really. Mathematically, we've got some really fancy notation to define them:

If you do know calculus, it's actually not that complicated of a concept. We're taking the difference between each value from some value raised to the nth power, where n is the moment number and integrating across the entire function from negative infinity to infinity. But intuitively, it's a lot easier than calculus.

**Note:**

Moments can be defined as quantitative measures of the shape of a probability density function.
