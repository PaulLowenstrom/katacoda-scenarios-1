You can see that the weights that I observed only went up to people that weighed 100 kilograms. What if I had someone who weighed 120 kilograms? Well, I could use that line to then figure out where would the height be for someone with 120 kilograms based on this previous data.

I don't know why they call it regression. Regression kind of implies that you're doing something backwards. I guess you can think of it in terms of you're creating a line to predict new values based on observations you made in the past, backwards in time, but it seems like a little bit of a stretch. It's just a confusing term quite honestly, and one way that we kind of obscure what we do with very simple concepts using very fancy terminology. All it is, is fitting a straight line to a set of data points.
