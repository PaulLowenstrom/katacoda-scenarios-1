So why am I even mentioning multi-level models? It is because I've seen it mentioned on job descriptions, in a couple of cases, as something that they want you to know about in a couple of cases. I've never had to use it in practice, but I think the important thing from the standpoint of getting a career in data science is that you at least are familiar with the concept, and you know what it means and some of the challenges involved in creating a multi-level model. I hope I've given you those concepts. With that, we can move on to the next section.

There you have the concepts of multi-level models. It's a very advanced topic, but you need to understand what the concept is, at least, and the concept itself is pretty simple. You just are looking at the effects at different levels, different hierarchies when you're trying to make a prediction. So maybe there are different layers of effects that have impacts on each other, and those different layers might have factors that interrelate with each other as well. Multi-level modeling tries to take account of all those different hierarchies and factors and how they interplay with each other. Rest assured that's all you need to know for now.
