If I had a really high order polynomial, it might swoop up at the top to catch that one outlier and then swoop downwards to catch the outliers there, and get a little bit more stable through where we have a lot of density, and maybe then it could potentially go all over the place trying to fit the last set of outliers at the end. If you see that sort of nonsense, you know you have too many orders, too many degrees in your polynomial, and you should probably bring it back down because, although it fits the data that you observed, it's not going to be useful for predicting data you haven't seen.

Imagine I have some curve that swoops way up and then back down again to fit outliers. My prediction for something in between there isn't going to be accurate. The curve really should be in the middle. Later in this book we'll talk about the main ways of detecting such overfitting, but for now, please just observe it and know we'll go deeper later.
