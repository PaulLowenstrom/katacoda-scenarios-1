What happens then, if we're trying to predict some value that is based on more than one other attribute? Let's say that the height of people not only depends on their weight, but also on their genetics or some other things that might factor into it. Well, that's where multivariate analysis comes in. You can actually build regression models that take more than one factor into account at once. It's actually pretty easy to do with Python.

Let's talk about multivariate regression, which is a little bit more complicated. The idea of multivariate regression is this: what if there's more than one factor that influences the thing you're trying to predict?

In our previous examples, we looked at linear regression. We talked about predicting people's heights based on their weight, for example. We assumed that the weight was the only thing that influenced their height, but maybe there are other factors too. We also looked at the effect of page speed on purchase amounts. Maybe there's more that influences purchase amounts than just page speed, and we want to find how these different factors all combine together to influence that value. So that's where multivariate regression comes in.
