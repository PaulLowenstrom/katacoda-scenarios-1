The first example that I want to give you of some Python code is right here. The following block of code represents some real Python code that we can actually run right within this view of the entire notebook page, but let's zoom in now and look at that code:

Let's take a look at what's going on. We have a list of numbers and a list in Python, kind of like an array in other languages. It is designated by these square brackets:

We have this data structure of a list that contains the numbers 1 through 6, and then to iterate through every number in that list, we'll say for number in listOfNumbers:, that's the Python syntax for iterating through a list of stuff and a colon.

**Note:**

Tabs and whitespaces have real meaning in Python, so you can't just format things the way you want to. You have to pay attention to them.
