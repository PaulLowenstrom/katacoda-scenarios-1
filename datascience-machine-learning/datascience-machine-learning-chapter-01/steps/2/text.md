Let's now explore using Jupyter Notebooks, which is also known as IPython Notebook. These days, the more modern name is the Jupyter Notebook, but a lot of people still call it an IPython Notebook, and I consider the names interchangeable for working developers as a result. I do also find the name IPython Notebooks helps me remember the notebook file name suffix which is .ipynb as you'll get to know very well in this book!

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for notebooks. Open and run `Outliers.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/Outliers.ipynb

As you can see here, notebooks are structured in such a way that I can intersperse my little notes and commentary about what you're seeing here within the actual code itself, and you can actually run this code within your web browser! So, it's a very handy format for me to give you sort of a little reference that you can use later on in life to go and remind yourself how these algorithms work that we're going to talk about, and actually experiment with them and play with them yourself.

The way that the IPython/Jupyter Notebook files work is that they actually run from within your browser, like a webpage, but they're backed by the Python engine that you installed. So you should be seeing a screen similar to the one shown in the previous screenshot.

You'll notice as you scroll down the notebook in your browser, there are code blocks. They're easy to spot because they contain our actual code.
