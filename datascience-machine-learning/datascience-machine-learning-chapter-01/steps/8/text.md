You can see the output right below the code. I ran the output before as I had actually saved it within my notebook, but if you want to actually run it yourself, you can just click within that block and click on the Play button, and we'll actually execute it and do it again. Just to convince yourself that it's really doing something, let's change the print statement to say something else, say, Hooray! We're all done. Let's party! If I run this now, you can see, sure enough, my message there has changed:

So again, the point I want to make is that whitespace is important. You will designate blocks of code that run together, you know, such as a for loop or if then statements, using indentation or tabs, so remember that. Also, pay attention to your colons too. You'll notice that a lot of these clauses begin with a colon.
