There are a few quirky things about the Python scripting language that you need to know, so let's dive in and just jump into the pool and learn some Python by writing some actual code.

#### Open Notebook
The Notebook opens in a new browser window. You can create a new notebook or open a local one. Check out the local folder `work` for notebooks. Open and run `Python101.ipynb` in the `work` folder.

You can also open the Jupyter Notebook at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/notebooks/work/Python101.ipynb



There are a few quirks about Python that are a little bit different than other languages you might have seen; so I just want to walk through what's different about Python from other scripting languages you may have worked with, and the best way to do that is by looking at some real examples. Let's dive right in and look at some Python code.

One cool thing about Python is that there are several ways to run code with Python. You can run it as a script, like you would with a normal programming language. You can also write in this thing called the IPython Notebook, which is what we're using here. So it's this format where you actually have a web browser-like view where you can actually write little notations and notes to yourself in HTML markup stuff, and you can also embed actual code that really runs using the Python interpreter.
