**Dereferencing a single element**
If you want to dereference a single element of the list you can just use the bracket like that:

```
y[1]
```

The output of the above code is as follows:

```
11
```

So `y[1]` will return element 1. Remember that y had 10, 11, 12 in it - observe the previous example, and we start counting from 0, so element 1 will actually be the second element in the list, or the number 11 in this case, alright?

**The sort function**

Finally, let's have a built-in sort function that you can use:

```
z = [3, 2, 1]
z.sort()
z
```

So if I start with list z, which is 3,2, and 1, I can call sort on that list, and z will now be sorted in order. The output of the above code is as follows:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```
