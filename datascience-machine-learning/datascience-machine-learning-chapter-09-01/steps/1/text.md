So far in this book we've talked about a lot of general data mining and machine learning techniques that you can use in your data science career, but they've all been running on your desktop. As such, you can only run as much data as a single machine can process using technologies such as Python and scikit-learn.

Now, everyone talks about big data, and odds are you might be working for a company that does in fact have big data to process. Big data meaning that you can't actually control it all, you can't actually wrangle it all on just one system. You need to actually compute it using the resources of an entire cloud, a cluster of computing resources. And that's where Apache Spark comes in. Apache Spark is a very powerful tool for managing big data, and doing machine learning on large Datasets. By the end of the chapter, you will have an in-depth knowledge of the following topics:

- Installing and working with Spark
- Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
- The MLlib (Machine Learning Library)
