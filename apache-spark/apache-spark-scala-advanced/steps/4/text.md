Collections
Task 5: Functions
Task 1: Let us first create a function that does not have any parameters or a return type. Enter into the paste mode in Scala console and execute the following code.

```:paste
//Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

def hello = {
println("Hello there!")
}

Now, exit out of the paste mode and simply call this function by its name.

hello()


As you can see from the screenshot above, Scala has automatically inferred the return type as unit which means no return type. Unit is similar to that of Void in Java.
