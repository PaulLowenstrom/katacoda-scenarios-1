**Step 2:** There might be scenarios where you would want to modify a variable. For that you can create a variable using var keyword instead of the val keyword as shown below.

`var newName: String = "Learning"`{{execute}} 

`newName = newName + " Voyage"`{{execute}} 

`println(newName)`{{execute}} 



As you can see in the screenshot, we have concatenated a new string to the same variable and printed out the new string to the console using mutability. Mutability should be only used when it is absolutely required for your application.

**Step 3:** We can apply a workaround to use transformations on immutable objects to create new immutable objects and achieve the same result as we got using the mutable objects. 

`val name: String = "Learning"`{{execute}} 

`val newName: String = name + " Voyage"`{{execute}} 

`println(newName)`{{execute}} 

 

As you can see from the screenshot above, we have applied the transformations on the immutable objects and achieve the same result as using the mutable objects.
