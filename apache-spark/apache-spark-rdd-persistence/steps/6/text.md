Letâ€™s go back to our example and see how we can use cache() and persist() methods.

```val data = sc.textFile("/some/path/records.txt")

Once we load the file using the TextFile API, we can now cache or persist the data RDD. Before we can cache or persist we have to import the following.

```import org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel

And then use the cache() method, if we need the default implementation of storage only.

```data.cache()
