RDD Caching and RDD Persistence play very important role in processing data with Spark. With caching and persistence, we will be able to store the RDD in-memory so that we do not have to recompute or evaluate the same RDD again, if required. This is an optimization technique which helps to complete jobs more quickly by saving the evaluation of RDD in memory.


We need following packages to perform the lab exercise: 
- Java Development Kit
- Scala
