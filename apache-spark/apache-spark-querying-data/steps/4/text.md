With Spark SQL, we can process data in two ways. The first way is to use the Spark SQL data manipulation language, which are essentially the traditional SQL queries we use in RDBMS.

The DataFrame API is programmatical kind of language. 

You are free to use any way to process the data based on your level of comfortability. Both the APIs are optimized and are efficient. Let is first use SQL queries to process data in this task and look at few operations we can perform.
