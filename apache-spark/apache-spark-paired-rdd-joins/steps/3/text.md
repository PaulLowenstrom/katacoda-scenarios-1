Task 5: Performing Joins on Paired RDDs

So far we have been working on single paired RDDs. In this task let us look at two paired RDDs by performing joins.

Step 1: Download the ratings.csv file from the URL below. This file contains four columns: userId, movieID, rating and timestamp.



ratings.csv - http://bit.ly/2QmnAH9

Please save this file in IdeaProjects/Spark/chapter_5 folder if not saved already in the previous tasks.

Step 2: Download the movies.csv file from the URL below. This file contains three columns: movieID, movieName and genre.

movies.csv - http://bit.ly/2EJj0Os

Please save this file in IdeaProjects/Spark/chapter_5 folder. 

We shall join these datasets based on the movieID.









SUMMARY

In this chapter we have looked at the RDD Key value pairs in detail. We have seen the types of operations we can apply on Paired RDDs. Also, we have seen the caching and persistence.
In the labs, we have created a paired RDD and applied transformations and operations on the paired RDD.
