**Step 2:** Create a new Scala object and name it averageUDAF. Next, we will need the following imports to implement a UADF. We haven’t used some of these imports so far. We shall learn about them as we continue with our program.

import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
import org.apache.spark.sql.{Row, SparkSession}

Now, that we have the required imports, we need to extend our object to inherit UserDefinedAggregateFunction as shown below.

object averageUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {

We have used the import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions. UserDefinedAggregateFunction so that we can inhert it’s methods in our program.

The program at this point should now look like the screenshot below.

 

Please ignore the error you see for object name. This will go away once we implement all the required methods for UDAF.
