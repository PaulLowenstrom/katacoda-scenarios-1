**Step 6:** Let us now write a print statement to print out the number of bad records in our input data.

println("The number of bad records in the input are  " + badRecords.value)
  }
}

 

With this we have successfully implementd Accumulators for Spark 2.x.

**Step 7:** Finally, let us run our code. You should see the results as shown in the screenshot below.

 

Task 4 is complete!
