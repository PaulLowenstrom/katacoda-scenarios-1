**Step 6:** Let us now write a print statement to print out the number of bad records in our input data.

```
println("The number of bad records in the input are  " + badRecords.value)
  }
}
```
 

With this we have successfully implementd Accumulators for Spark 2.x.

**Step 7:** Finally, let us run our code. You should see the results as shown in the screenshot below.

 To run this program from the terminal, simply run the following command. The program will the then be compiled and executed.
`sbt "runMain training.countersV2"`{{execute}} 

Task is complete!
