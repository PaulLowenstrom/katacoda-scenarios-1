SUMMARY

Resilient Distributed Dataset also known as RDD is the basic data structure of Spark which is immutable and fault tolerant collection of elements that can be computed in parallel over a cluster of machines.
Spark is a master-slave architecture. Spark consists of a Driver Program as the master and executors as slaves. A cluster manager is used to manage resources across the cluster.
In the labs, we have installed Spark to our machines and learned RDD basic operations. We have also installed and configured IntelliJ IDEA as IDE for our Spark code.
