Apache Spark is an open source, fast and unified parallel large-scale data processing engine. It provides a framework for programming with distributed processing of large datasets at high speed. Spark supports most popular programming languages such as Java, Python, Scala and R. 

Spark is scalable, meaning, it can run on a single desktop machine or a laptop to a cluster of thousands of machines. Spark provides a set of inbuilt libraries which can be accessed to perform data analysis over a large dataset. However, if your requirement doesnâ€™t get satisfied with the inbuilt libraries, you can write one or explore countless external libraries from open source communities on the internet.
