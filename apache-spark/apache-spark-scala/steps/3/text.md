Task 1: 
**Step 1:** From the terminal, run the following commands to install JDK (Java Development Kit).

`sudo apt-get update`{{execute}} 

This will update the package index. You might be asked to enter your password after you run the command above. 

**Step 2:** Once you run the above command, run the following command to actually download and install JDK.

`sudo apt-get install default-jdk`{{execute}}
