Now that we have installed Java, we are ready to install Scala and start writing some Scala code!

**Step 1:** Run the following commands from the terminal to install Scala.

wget www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.12.8.deb
dpkg -i scala-2.12.8.deb

 

The prompt will ask you to hit ‘Y’ after running the above command as shown in the screenshot. Hit ‘Y’ from your keyboard to continue with the installation and finally hit the Enter key.

**Step 2:** Verify your Scala installation version by running the following command.
 
`scala -version`{{execute}}
