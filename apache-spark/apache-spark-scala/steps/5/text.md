After the installation is completed successfully, type scala in your terminal and you will be prompted with a Scala prompt.

`scala`{{execute}}

 The scala prompt is the interactive shell where you can write and run Scala code. This interactive shell is also known as `REPL`.

**Step 4:** You can now start writing Scala code! Letâ€™s start by printing the classic "Hello world!" from the shell. To do this simply type the following code and hit enter on your keyboard.

`println("Hello World!")`{{execute}}


As you can see from the screenshot, the output is shown below immediately as soon as you hit enter.

**Step 5:** To quit the Scala REPL, you use the following command.

`:q`{{execute}}


You are now back to the terminal prompt.

Task 2 is complete!
