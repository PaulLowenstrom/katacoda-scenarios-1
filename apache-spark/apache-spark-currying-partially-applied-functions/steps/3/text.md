Function currying in Scala
Function currying in Scala is used to create partially applied functions. The curried functions are declared with multiple parameter groups with each group enclosed in paranthesis.

For example,

```
def sum(a: Int) (b:Int): Int = {
> a + b
> }
```

There can also be multiple parameters in each parameter group. We can then use this curried function and create partially applied functions.
