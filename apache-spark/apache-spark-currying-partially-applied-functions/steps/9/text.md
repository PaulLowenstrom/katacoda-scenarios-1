**Step 3:** Similarly, let is partially apply the sumProd function which we created in the step 2 of previous task.

```val sumProdObj = sumProd(5, 6)_


We can then pass the held back parameters at a later time as shown below.

```sumProdObj(7, 8)

 

The result is as shown in the screenshot above.

**Step 4:** We have also created a prod function in the previous task. You can also apply partial functions on that function as well. Please complete this step by yourself as a lab challenge.

Task 2 is complete!
