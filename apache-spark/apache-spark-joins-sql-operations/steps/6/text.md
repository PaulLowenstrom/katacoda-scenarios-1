**Step 4:** Now that we have our dataFrames, let us create a temp view so that we can run our join query against them.

movies.createOrReplaceTempView("movies")
ratings.createOrReplaceTempView("ratings")



**Step 5:** We now have our views. All we need to do now is to perform the join. We can join this using the SQL query as shown below.

val joinedDf = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM movies JOIN ratings ON movies.movieId = ratings.movieId"

Finally, let us call the show method on our joinedDf dataFrame and run the program.

joinedDf.show()

You should see the joined table as shown in the screenshot below.

 

Task is complete!
