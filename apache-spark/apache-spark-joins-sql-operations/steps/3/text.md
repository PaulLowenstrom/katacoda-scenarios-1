Task 5: Joins using Spark SQL

Let us now use Spark SQL to join two dataFrames.

Step 1: Download the ratings.csv file from the URL below. This file contains four columns: userId, movieID, rating and timestamp.

ratings-head.csv - http://bit.ly/2FPdhHE

Please save this file in IdeaProjects/Spark/chapter_7 folder if not saved already in the previous tasks.

Step 2: Download the movies.csv file from the URL below. This file contains three columns: movieID, movieName and genre.

movies-head.csv - http://bit.ly/2RTg72N

Please save this file in IdeaProjects/Spark/chapter_7 folder. 

We shall join these datasets based on the movieID.
