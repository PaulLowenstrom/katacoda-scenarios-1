With this we have successfully set the initial value for accumulator and named the counter as bad records. We now have to write a logic on how to determine good and bad records. We can achieve this by writing a recordParser object and defining a parse method within the object. Let us see that in the next task.

 

We shall come back to this program in Task 3, once we have figured out how to separate bad records with good records so that we can count the number of bad records.

Task is complete!
