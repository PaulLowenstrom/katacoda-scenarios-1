Let us start this exercise by looking at Accumulators.
Task 1: Using Accumulator method

In this task and the next two, we shall be looking at Accumulators API in Spark 1.x to count the number of malformed records and separate the malformed records from the good records.

Step 1: Download the ratings-malformed.csv file from the URL below. This file contains four columns: userId, movieID, rating and timestamp.

Ratings-malformed.csv - http://bit.ly/2WuTese

Please save this file in IdeaProjects/Spark/chapter_6 folder. (Please create a folder named chapter_6 in the home folder.)

Please note that this file is different from the file we used in the previous lab exercises. This file has malformed records.
