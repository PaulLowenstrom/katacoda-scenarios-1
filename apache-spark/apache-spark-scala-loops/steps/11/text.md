Now, enter into the paste mode again and execute the following code to perform a do while loop.

`:paste`{{execute}}

After pasting following code in the scala terminal, Press  `Ctrl` + `D` to run code.

```var i = 0

do{
i += 1
println(i)

} while (i < 5)```{{execute}}

The difference between while and do while loops is that any expression within the do clause runs at least once irrespective of the condition in while clause.
