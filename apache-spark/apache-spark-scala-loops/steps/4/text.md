However, you do not even have to specify the data type. Scala is smart enough to infer the type based on the value. You need not explicitly specify the data type while declaring a variable as shown below.

`val num = 256`{{execute}}


As you can see from the screenshot above, Scala has automatically inferred the type of the variable as Int.

You can also do this for a String or any other data type as shown below.

`val name = "Learning Voyage"`{{execute}}

`val decimal = 25.3545`{{execute}}
