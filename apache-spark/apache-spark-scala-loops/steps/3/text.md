**Step 1:** Let us now look into more data types as discussed in Data Types in Scala section and see how we can create them.

`val num: Int = 255`{{execute}}

The above piece of code creates an immutable variable num of type Integer with a value of 255. Similarly, we can create immutable variables of all the other data types as shown below.

`val longNum: Long = 89416414`{{execute}}

`val decimal: Double = 85.5545`{{execute}}

`val decimalf: Float = 54.24f`{{execute}}

`val letter: Char = 'f'`{{execute}}

Please note that there are only single quotes for Char type while there are double quotes for a String type.

`val lieDetector: Boolean = true`{{execute}}


Please note that the Data type name starts with a upper case letter unlike the other programming languages.
