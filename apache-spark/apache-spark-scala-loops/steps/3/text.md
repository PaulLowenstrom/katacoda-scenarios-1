**Step 4:** Let us now look into more data types as discussed in Data Types in Scala section and see how we can create them.

 
Loops

Functions
Collections

```val num: Int = 255

The above piece of code creates an immutable variable num of type Integer with a value of 255. Similarly, we can create immutable variables of all the other data types as shown below.

```val longNum: Long = 89416414

```val decimal: Double = 85.5545

```val decimalf: Float = 54.24f

```val letter: Char = ‘f’

Please note that there are only single quotes for Char type while there are double quotes for a String type.

```val lieDetector: Boolean = true


 

Please note that the Data type name starts with a upper case letter unlike the other programming languages.
