**Step 5:** Now that we have our paired RDD, let us group all the tags by movieID using the groupByKey function.

```
val grouped = RDDPair.groupByKey()
```
 

Let us now print out the result of grouped RDD to the console.

```
grouped.collect.foreach(println)
```

The output is as shown in the screenshot below with all the tags for a movie are grouped together.


**Step 5:** To run this program from the terminal, simply run the following command. The program will the then be compiled and executed.

`sbt "runMain training.tags"`{{execute}} 
 

You may optionally convert the values from compactBuffer to a list by simply mapping the output and converting them to a List as shown below.
