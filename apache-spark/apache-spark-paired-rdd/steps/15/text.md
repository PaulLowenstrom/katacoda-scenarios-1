You can also sort the result by the key by referring the first element in the sortBy function or simply using the sortByKey function key as shown below.

```
val sorted = avgRatings.sortByKey()
```

Finally, you can sort the results in descending order when sortByKey is used by passing argument as false for the function.

```
val sorted = avgRatings.sortByKey(false)
```

Task is complete!
