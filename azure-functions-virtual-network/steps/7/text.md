With VNet Integration enabled, you can create a proxy in your function app to forward requests to the VM running in the virtual network.

- In your function app, select **Proxies** > +, then use the proxy settings in the table below the image:

Setting | Suggested value | Description
--- | --- | ---
`Name` | `	Plant` | The name can be any value. It's used to identify the proxy.
`Route Template` | `/plant` | Route that maps to a VM resource.
`Backend URL` | `http://<YOUR_VM_IP>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/assets/images/header.jpg` | Replace '<YOUR_VM_IP>' with the IP address of your WordPress VM that you created earlier. This mapping returns a single file from the site.

- Select **Create** to add the proxy to your function app.
