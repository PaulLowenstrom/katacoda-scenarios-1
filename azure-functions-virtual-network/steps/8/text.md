In your browser, try to access the URL you used as the Backend URL. As expected, the request times out. A timeout occurs because your WordPress site is connected only to your virtual network and not the internet.

Copy the Proxy URL value from your new proxy and paste it into the address bar of your browser. The returned image is from the WordPress site running inside your virtual network.

Your function app is connected to both the internet and your virtual network. The proxy is receiving a request over the public internet, and then acting as a simple HTTP proxy to forward that request to the connected virtual network. The proxy then relays the response back to you publicly over the internet.
