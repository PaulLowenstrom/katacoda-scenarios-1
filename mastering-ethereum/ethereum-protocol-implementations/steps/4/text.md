The update command is used to change the password of a specific account so that you can unlock it easily if you decide to do so. You can use this command to remove your existing password.
`geth account update <your-accounts-address>`{{copy}}

You can also unlock your Geth account using the following command:
`geth --unlock <your-accounts-address> --password <your-password>`{{copy}

This essentially unlocks your Geth account so that you can send transactions via the console directly.
