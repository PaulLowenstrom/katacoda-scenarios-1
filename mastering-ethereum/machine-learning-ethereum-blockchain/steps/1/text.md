Blockchain and AI have been the most interesting topics in recent years for a good reason: they are the most advanced technologies that have been created to disrupt most established businesses. The fact that we can teach a computer to learn by itself is something very powerful, and means that will continue evolving the machine learning systems of the future will continue to evolve. Likewise with blockchain: the field of distributed computing is just beginning, and it will be the default solution for most problems in the future. So why not combine both for a revolutionary invention? It turns out that they work nicely together, and we can create very interesting dApps that benefit from both worlds, particularly by using them to create decentralized marketplaces for solving machine learning problems that reward users for their computing power.

In this scenario, we're going to cover the following topics:

- Understanding machine learning
- Decentralized machine learning marketplaces
- Building a smart contract machine learning marketplace
