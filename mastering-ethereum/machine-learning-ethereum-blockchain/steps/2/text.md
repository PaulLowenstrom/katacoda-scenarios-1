Our ML marketplace will work with linear regression algorithms exclusively to simplify the process so that you understand how it all ties together. I encourage you to expand the solution for more advanced models to practice your ML and blockchain skills. To apply a simple linear regression algorithm, we need the following things:

- A prediction function to generate a prediction from data
- A cost function to combine the prediction results
- An optimization algorithm to train our algorithm with gradient descent, which will fine tune the predictions for more precise results
- A train function to improve our algorithm
