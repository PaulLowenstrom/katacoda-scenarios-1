In this scenario, we will learn all the steps from scratch including planning, developing the code, and testing the applications that use the smart contract .

Let's first setup VScode editor and clone respository. Clone the following repository by executing following command in the terminal.
`git clone https://github.com/athertahir/mastering-ethereum.git`{{execute}}

Now, move in the directory which contains the sample application
`cd mastering-ethereum/Chapter05/dapp-master/dapp-master`{{execute}}

**Note:**
Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and navigate to `mastering-ethereum/Chapter05/dapp-master/dapp-master` folder to view files.

Mastering Ethereum development starts with a lot of theory and technicality, but, at some point you'll have to take the leap in order to start applying your recently-acquired knowledge on real-world scenarios that build your portfolio. That's why we're going to create a blockchain-based social media platform, since it's one of the best use cases of blockchain technology, given that we provide people with trust. Unfortunately, many centralized social media companies are abusing that trust by stealing and monetizing users' privacy. Social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook are famous because they give people the power to stay in touch with many individuals in one single interface that takes advantage of the internet's capabilities.

This chapter will take you through the challenge of creating a dynamic social media platform that lives entirely on the blockchain without centralized servers. You will understand how to create a beautiful user interface with React. Then you'll explore how to organize the information better so that you allow people to find the content that they want using smart contracts. Finally, you'll tie everything together using web3 and you'll be able to use your social media platform.

In this chapter, we're going to cover the following topics:

Understanding decentralized social media
Creating the user interface
Building the smart contract
Finishing the dApp
