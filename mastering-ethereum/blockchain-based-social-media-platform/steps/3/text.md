Creating the user interface
The user interface for this particular project will be focused around content and hashtags since hashtags are the way users will discover new trending content. Users will be able to subscribe to particular hashtags to receive content from those topics on their feed.

As usual, we start by setting up a new project with Truffle. Follow these steps to set up your project:

Clone the startup repository (https://github.com/merlox/dapp) which includes the initial configuration to work on your React dApp:
```
git clone https://github.com/merlox/dapp
Rename the repository to social-media-dappto organize the content:
```
mv dapp/ social-media-dapp/


Now you can start creating your user interface. You already know how to do it, so why not go ahead and create your own before seeing mine? You'll be amazed at what you're capable of doing by yourself at this point, so I encourage you to experiment to build your own systems. The idea is that we build this dApp together by guiding you through the steps until you have a high-quality dApp that you can use to build your resume or develop further for an ICO, or as open source software for the betterment of humanity.
