When you are developing on a local computer, it's easy to create a .zip file of the function app project folder on your development computer.

However, you might have created your functions by using the editor in the Azure portal. You can download an existing function app project in one of these ways:

From the Azure portal:

Sign in to the Azure portal, and then go to your function app.

On the Overview tab, select Download app content. Select your download options, and then select Download.


The downloaded .zip file is in the correct format to be republished to your function app by using .zip push deployment. The portal download can also add the files needed to open your function app directly in Visual Studio.
