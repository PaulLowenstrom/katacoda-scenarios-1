Cloud Shell utilizes Azure File storage to persist files across sessions. On initial start, Cloud Shell prompts you to associate a new or existing file share to persist files across sessions.

**Note:**
Bash and PowerShell share the same file share. Only one file share can be associated with automatic mounting in Cloud Shell.
