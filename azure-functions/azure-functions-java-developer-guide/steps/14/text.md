In Functions, app settings, such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. You can access these settings by using, System.getenv("AzureWebJobsStorage").

The following example gets the application setting, with the key named **myAppSetting**:

```
public class Function {
    public String echo(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {"post"}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) String req, ExecutionContext context) {
        context.getLogger().info("My app setting value: "+ System.getenv("myAppSetting"));
        return String.format(req);
    }
}
```
