Add the helper functions and dependencies
Some helper functions for preparing the input image and making a prediction using TensorFlow are in a file named predict.py in the resources folder. Copy this file into the classify function's folder.

Linux and macOS:
bash

Copy
cp ../resources/predict.py classify
Windows:
PowerShell

Copy
copy ..\resources\predict.py classify
Confirm that classify now contains a file named predict.py.
