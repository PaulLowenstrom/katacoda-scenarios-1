In this scenario, we will demonstrates how Azure Functions allows you to use Python and TensorFlow with a machine learning model to classify an image based on its contents.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

1. Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python
2. Import a custom TensorFlow machine learning model into a function app
3. Build a serverless HTTP API for predicting whether a photo contains a dog or a cat
4. Consume the API from a web application
