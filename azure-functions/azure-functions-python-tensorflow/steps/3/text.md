To begin, open a terminal and clone the following repository using Git:


git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial.git

cd functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial

The repository contains a few folders.
- **start:** This is your working folder for the tutorial
- **end:** This is the final result and full implementation for your reference
- **resources:** Contains the machine learning model and helper libraries
- **frontend:** A website that calls the function app

**Note:** We will provide values and finish generating the project in the next step.
