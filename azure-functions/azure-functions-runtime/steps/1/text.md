A function app runs on a specific version of the Azure Functions runtime. There are two major versions: `1.x` and `2.x`. By default, function apps that are created version **2.x** of the runtime. This article explains how to configure a function app in Azure to run on the version you choose.

Azure Functions lets you target a specific version of the runtime by using the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` application setting in a function app. The function app is kept on the specified major version until you explicitly choose to move to a new version.
