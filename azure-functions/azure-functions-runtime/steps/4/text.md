Use the following procedure to view and update the runtime version currently used by a function app.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to your function app.

2. Under Configured Features, choose Function app settings.

3. In the Function app settings tab, locate the Runtime version. **Note:** the specific runtime version and the         requested major version. In the example below, the version is set to ~2.

4. To pin your function app to the version 1.x runtime, choose **~1** under Runtime version. This switch is disabled when you have functions in your app.

5. When you change the runtime version, go back to the **Overview** tab and choose **Restart** to restart the app. The function app restarts running on the version `1.x` runtime, and the version 1.x templates are used when you create functions.

**Note:**
Using the Azure portal, you can't change the runtime version for a function app that already contains functions.
