1. Navigate back to your frontend function app in the portal.

3. Use proxy settings as specified in the table.
    Field | Sample value | Description
    --- | --- | ---
    `Name` | `HelloProxy` | A friendly name used only for management
    `Route template` | `/api/remotehello` | Determines what route is used to invoke this proxy
    `Backend URL` | `https://%HELLO_HOST%/api/hello` | Specifies the endpoint to which the request should be proxied

    **Note:** that Proxies does not provide the /api base path prefix, and this must be included in the route template.

    The `%HELLO_HOST%` syntax will reference the app setting you created earlier. The resolved URL will point to your original function.

4. Click Create.

You can try out your new proxy by copying the Proxy URL and testing it in the browser or with your favorite HTTP client.

- For an anonymous function use:
    * `https://YOURPROXYAPP.azurewebsites.net/api/remotehello?name="Proxies"`
- For a function with authorization use:
    * `https://YOURPROXYAPP.azurewebsites.net/api/remotehello?code=YOURCODE&name="Proxies"`
