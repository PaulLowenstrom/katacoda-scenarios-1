In this scenario, you learn how Azure Functions allows you to build highly scalable APIs. Azure Functions comes with a collection of built-in HTTP triggers and bindings, which make it easy to author an endpoint in a variety of languages, including Node.JS, C#, and more. In this article, you will customize an HTTP trigger to handle specific actions in your API design. You will also prepare for growing your API by integrating it with Azure Functions Proxies and setting up mock APIs. All of this is accomplished on top of the Functions serverless compute environment, so you don't have to worry about scaling resources - you can just focus on your API logic.
