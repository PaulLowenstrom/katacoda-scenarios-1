Here is the folder structure of an Azure Functions Java project:

```
FunctionsProject
 | - src
 | | - main
 | | | - java
 | | | | - FunctionApp
 | | | | | - MyFirstFunction.java
 | | | | | - MySecondFunction.java
 | - target
 | | - azure-functions
 | | | - FunctionApp
 | | | | - FunctionApp.jar
 | | | | - host.json
 | | | | - MyFirstFunction
 | | | | | - function.json
 | | | | - MySecondFunction
 | | | | | - function.json
 | | | | - bin
 | | | | - lib
 | - pom.xml
```

You can use a shared host.json file to configure the function app. Each function has its own code file (.java) and binding configuration file (function.json).

You can put more than one function in a project. Avoid putting your functions into separate jars. The FunctionApp in the target directory is what gets deployed to your function app in Azure.
