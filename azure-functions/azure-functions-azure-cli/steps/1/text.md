In this scenario, we will walks you through how to create your first function from the command line or terminal. You use the Azure CLI to create a function app, which is the serverless infrastructure that hosts your function. The function code project is generated from a template by using the Azure Functions Core Tools, which is also used to deploy the function app project to Azure.

#### Prerequisites
Before running this sample, you must have the following:

- Install Azure Functions Core Tools version.
- Install the Azure CLI. This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run az --version to find the version you have
- An active Azure subscription.


If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

**Note:** Creating an azure account is optional, if you don't want to publish your function on Azure.
