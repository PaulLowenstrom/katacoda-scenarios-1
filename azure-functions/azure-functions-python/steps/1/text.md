In this scenario, you will learn how to use command-line tools to create a Python project that runs in Azure Functions. The function you create is triggered by HTTP requests. Finally, you publish your project to run as a serverless function in Azure.

#### Prerequisites
Before running this sample, you must have the following:
- Install Python 3.6.x.
- Install Azure Functions Core Tools version.
- Install the Azure CLI. This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run az --version to find the version you have
- An active Azure subscription.


If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

**Note:** Creating an azure account is optional, if you don't want to publish your function on Azure.
