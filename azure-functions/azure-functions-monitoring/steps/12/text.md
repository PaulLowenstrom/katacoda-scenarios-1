You can view both types of log streams in the portal.

Built-in log streaming
To view streaming logs in the portal, select the Platform features tab in your function app. Then, under Monitoring, choose Log streaming.


This connects your app to the log streaming service and application logs are displayed in the window. You can toggle between Application logs and Web server logs.
