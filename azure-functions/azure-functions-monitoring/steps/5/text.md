The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. 

#### Environment variables
In Functions, app settings, such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. You can access these settings by using, System.getenv("AzureWebJobsStorage").

The following example gets the application setting, with the key named myAppSetting:

#### Java

```
public class Function {
    public String echo(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {"post"}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) String req, ExecutionContext context) {
        context.getLogger().info("My app setting value: "+ System.getenv("myAppSetting"));
        return String.format(req);
    }
}
```

When you develop a function app locally, you must maintain local copies of these values in the local.settings.json project file. To learn more, see Local settings file.
