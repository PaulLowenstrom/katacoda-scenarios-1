Application Insights Analytics gives you access to all telemetry data in the form of tables in a database. Analytics provides a query language for extracting, manipulating, and visualizing the data.

Here's a query example that shows the distribution of requests per worker over the last 30 minutes.

```
requests
| where timestamp > ago(30m) 
| summarize count() by cloud_RoleInstance, bin(timestamp, 1m)
| render timechart
```

The tables that are available are shown in the Schema tab on the left. You can find data generated by function invocations in the following tables:

Table |	Description
--- | ---
`traces` | `	Logs created by the runtime and by function code.
`requests` | `	One request for each function invocation.
`exceptions` | `	Any exceptions thrown by the runtime.
`customMetrics` | `	The count of successful and failing invocations, success rate, and duration.
`customEvents` | `	Events tracked by the runtime, for example: HTTP requests that trigger a function.
`performanceCounters` | `	Information about the performance of the servers that the functions are running on.

The other tables are for availability tests, and client and browser telemetry. You can implement custom telemetry to add data to them.

Within each table, some of the Functions-specific data is in a customDimensions field. For example, the following query retrieves all traces that have log level Error.


```
traces 
| where customDimensions.LogLevel == "Error"
```

The runtime provides the customDimensions.LogLevel and customDimensions.Category fields. You can provide additional fields in logs that you write in your function code.
