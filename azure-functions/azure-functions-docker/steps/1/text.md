Azure Functions lets you host your functions on Linux in your own custom container. You can also host on a default Azure App Service container. This functionality requires the Functions `2.x` runtime.

In this scenario, you learn how to deploy your functions to Azure as a custom Docker image. This pattern is useful when you need to customize the built-in container image. You may want to use a custom image when your functions need a specific language version or require a specific dependency or configuration that isn't provided within the built-in image.

This scenario walks you through how to use Azure Functions Core Tools to create a function in a custom Linux image. You publish this image to a function app in Azure, which was created using the Azure CLI. Later, you update your function to connect to Azure Queue storage. You also enable.

In this scenario, you learn how to:

- Create a function app and Dockerfile using Core Tools.
- Build a custom image using Docker.
- Publish a custom image to a container registry.
- Create an Azure Storage account.
- Create a Premium hosting plan.
- Deploy a function app from Docker Hub.
- Add application settings to the function app.
